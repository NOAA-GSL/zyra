## AI Design Prompt
> Create a "Get Started" footer section for a scientific poster. Full poster width with a Navy (#00172D) or Deep Teal (#091A1B) background and white/light text. Heading "Get Started" in Neutral 50 (#FEFEFE), 24pt bold. Show 3 install commands in a code block with a slightly lighter background. Display resource links (GitHub, PyPI, Docs, Wiki, DOI) as a horizontal row of labeled links. Optionally include a QR code in the bottom-right corner pointing to the GitHub repo. This is the bottom strip of the poster -- it should feel like a strong call to action.
