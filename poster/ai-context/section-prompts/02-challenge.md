# Section 2: The Challenge

## Purpose
Establish the problem that Zyra solves. Set the stage for why the framework exists.

## Content

Environmental and scientific workflows span heterogeneous data sources (HTTP, FTP, S3, APIs) and formats (GRIB2, NetCDF, GeoTIFF). They require repeatable transformation chains and produce diverse outputs -- static maps, animations, interactive pages, and datasets. Existing approaches often rely on ad-hoc scripts that break when data changes and lack reproducibility across teams and environments.

Zyra provides a lightweight, CLI-first framework that standardizes common steps while remaining extensible for domain-specific logic.

## Layout
- Full width or left column, near the top
- 2-3 sentences only -- keep it concise
- Use a subtle background color (Neutral 200 #F7F5EE) or a bordered card to distinguish from other sections

## AI Design Prompt
> Design a "The Challenge" section for a scientific poster. Use a light card with Neutral 200 (#F7F5EE) background and a left border in Cable Blue (#00529E). The heading "The Challenge" should be in Navy (#00172D), 24pt bold. Body text in Neutral 900 (#232323), 14-16pt. Keep it to two short paragraphs. The text describes how environmental data spans many sources and formats, and how Zyra provides a standardized framework. This section should feel like a problem statement that naturally leads into the pipeline architecture diagram below it.
