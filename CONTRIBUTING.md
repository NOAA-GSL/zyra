## Branching Workflow

To keep development organized, we use a two-branch model:

- **`main`** ‚Üí Stable, production-ready branch.  
  - Always passes tests and CI/CD.  
  - Used for tagged releases.  
  - Do **not** commit directly to `main`.

- **`staging`** ‚Üí Integration branch.  
  - Collects feature branches and fixes before merging into `main`.  
  - Used for testing, docs, and CI validation.  

### Rules
1. **Feature Development**
   - Branch off `staging`:  
     ```bash
     git checkout staging
     git pull origin staging
     git checkout -b feature/my-feature
     ```
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) into `staging`.

2. **Testing & Integration**
   - PRs are merged into `staging`.  
   - CI/CD runs against `staging`.  
   - Once stable, `staging` is merged into `main`.  

3. **Syncing Main & Staging**
   - Occasionally merge `main ‚Üí staging` to keep hotfixes and metadata aligned.  
   - Always merge `staging ‚Üí main` via PR when ready to release.

## Workflow Gap Issues & PRs

Zyra now uses structured **Workflow Gap** issue and PR templates to ensure new CLI functionality is properly tracked.

### Filing Bug Reports
- Use the `üêû Bug Report` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`).
- Provide clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.

### Filing Feature Requests
- Use the `‚ú® Feature Request` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`).
- Describe the feature, motivation, proposed solution, and alternatives.
- Use this template only for enhancements that do **not** map directly to CLI commands.


### Filing Workflow Gap Issues
- Use the `‚ö° Workflow Gap / Missing Command` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workflow_gap.md`).
- Clearly describe:
  - Which CLI commands exist today
  - What is missing
  - Why the feature is needed
- The template will guide you to include an implementation plan and examples.

### Filing Task Issues (Maintenance / Chores)
- Use the `üßπ Task` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`).
- Use this for non-functional work such as refactors, dependency updates, CI or docs maintenance, code hygiene, and cleanup tasks.
- Do not use for bugs or new features; if the work changes CLI semantics or adds commands, prefer the appropriate Bug/Feature/Workflow Gap template.
- Please include:
  - A concise scope statement (what is and is not in scope)
  - Acceptance criteria (clear, testable completion conditions)
  - Impact/risk notes (blast radius, rollback considerations)
  - Validation steps (how reviewers can verify the task)
  - Links to related issues/PRs

### Submitting PRs for Workflow Gaps
- All PRs that add CLI functionality should link to the related Workflow Gap issue.
- The PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) includes a checklist:
  - Add tests
  - Write comprehensive **docstrings** (for auto-generated docs)
  - Include examples in workflows
- Ensure all boxes are checked before requesting review.

By following these templates, contributors help keep Zyra‚Äôs CLI aligned with real workflows and ensure documentation stays accurate and reproducible.

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+ required.  
- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).  
- Run `ruff` and `pytest` locally before opening a PR.

---

## Testing

1. Install dev dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

---

## Pull Requests

- Make sure your branch is up-to-date with `staging`.  
- Include descriptive commit messages.  
- Request a review from at least one maintainer.  
 - Link the related issue (Bug/Feature/Workflow Gap/Task) in the PR description.  

---

## Releases

- Releases are tagged from `main`.  
- `staging` must be fully merged into `main` before tagging.

Thanks again for contributing!

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the DCO to ensure that contributors have the right to submit their work. The full text is included in the `DCO` file at the repository root.

All commits must include a Signed-off-by line matching your Git author information. Use the `-s` flag when committing to add this automatically:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add feature X"
```

If you forgot to sign off, amend the most recent commit:

```bash
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
```

For multiple commits, you can interactively rebase and sign each commit:

```bash
git rebase -i <base-branch>
# then for each commit: edit -> git commit --amend -s --no-edit -> git rebase --continue
```

Notes
- The Signed-off-by line must include your real name and a reachable email, for example:
  `Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>`
- Ensure your `git config user.name` and `user.email` are correct.
- Co-authored commits require a Signed-off-by for each author.
- The DCO check will run on pull requests; failures include instructions on how to fix your commits.

Enable global sign-off (recommended)

To automatically include a DCO sign-off on every commit from your machine, enable global sign-off:

```bash
git config --global format.signoff true
```

This works with most Git clients and IDEs (including VS Code) and reduces the chance of missing a sign-off.
