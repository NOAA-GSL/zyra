## License and Contributor Terms

- Zyra is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See `LICENSE` at the repository root.
- By submitting a pull request, issue suggestion, or any code/documentation/artwork ("Contribution"),
  you agree to license your Contribution under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and you represent that you have the
  right to do so.
- Do not contribute code or assets you don't have rights to. If you include third-party code or data,
  ensure it is compatible with the Apache License, Version 2.0 and include proper attribution as required by the original license.
- No CLA is required at this time; contributions are accepted under the project's Apache License terms.
- This project enforces the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) via the GitHub DCO app approved by NOAA. All commits must include a Signed-off-by trailer.

If you have questions about licensing or attribution, please open an issue before submitting your PR.

### Contributing on behalf of an employer or institution

If you are creating contributions as part of your employment (e.g., as a
university researcher, corporate developer, or federal employee acting in your
official duties), please ensure that your employer permits contributions to
Apache-2.0 licensed open-source projects before submitting. The DCO
`Signed-off-by` line is a certification that you have the right to submit the
work — for employees, that right typically depends on employer policy.

A few common cases:

- **US federal employees** working in their official duties: contributions are
  generally in the public domain in the United States under 17 USC § 105;
  sign-off is still required to attest provenance.
- **University faculty, staff, and students**: check with your department,
  principal investigator, or technology transfer office. Some institutions
  permit Apache-2.0 contributions broadly; others require prior approval.
- **Corporate employees**: check with your employer's open-source program
  office or legal team. Many employers have a list of pre-approved open-source
  licenses; Apache 2.0 is commonly on it.

If you're unsure, open a Discussion or contact the maintainers before
contributing significant work, and we'll help you find the right path.

## Branching Workflow

To keep development organized, we use a two-branch model:

- **`main`** → Stable, production-ready branch.
  - Always passes tests and CI/CD.
  - Used for tagged releases.
  - Do **not** commit directly to `main`.

- **`staging`** → Integration branch.
  - Collects feature branches and fixes before merging into `main`.
  - Used for testing, docs, and CI validation.

### Rules

1. **Feature Development**
   - Branch off `staging`:

     ```
     git checkout staging
     git pull origin staging
     git checkout -b feature/my-feature
     ```

   - Open a Pull Request (PR) into `staging`.

2. **Testing & Integration**
   - PRs are merged into `staging`.
   - CI/CD runs against `staging`.
   - Once stable, `staging` is merged into `main`.

3. **Syncing Main & Staging**
   - Occasionally merge `main → staging` to keep hotfixes and metadata aligned.
   - Always merge `staging → main` via PR when ready to release.

## Workflow Gap Issues & PRs

Zyra now uses structured **Workflow Gap** issue and PR templates to ensure new CLI functionality is properly tracked.

### Filing Bug Reports

- Use the `🐞 Bug Report` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`).
- Provide clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and environment details.

### Filing Feature Requests

- Use the `✨ Feature Request` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`).
- Describe the feature, motivation, proposed solution, and alternatives.
- Use this template only for enhancements that do **not** map directly to CLI commands.

### Filing Workflow Gap Issues

- Use the `⚡ Workflow Gap / Missing Command` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workflow_gap.md`).
- Clearly describe:
  - Which CLI commands exist today
  - What is missing
  - Why the feature is needed
- The template will guide you to include an implementation plan and examples.

### Filing Task Issues (Maintenance / Chores)

- Use the `🧹 Task` template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`).
- Use this for non-functional work such as refactors, dependency updates, CI or docs maintenance, code hygiene, and cleanup tasks.
- Do not use for bugs or new features; if the work changes CLI semantics or adds commands, prefer the appropriate Bug/Feature/Workflow Gap template.
- Please include:
  - A concise scope statement (what is and is not in scope)
  - Acceptance criteria (clear, testable completion conditions)
  - Impact/risk notes (blast radius, rollback considerations)
  - Validation steps (how reviewers can verify the task)
  - Links to related issues/PRs

### Submitting PRs for Workflow Gaps

- All PRs that add CLI functionality should link to the related Workflow Gap issue.
- The PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) includes a checklist:
  - Add tests
  - Write comprehensive **docstrings** (for auto-generated docs)
  - Include examples in workflows
- Ensure all boxes are checked before requesting review.

By following these templates, contributors help keep Zyra's CLI aligned with real workflows and ensure documentation stays accurate and reproducible.

## Code Style

- Python 3.10+ required.
- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Run `ruff` and `pytest` locally before opening a PR.

---

## Testing

1. Install dev dependencies:

   ```
   poetry install
   ```

2. Run tests:

   ```
   pytest
   ```

---

## Pull Requests

- Make sure your branch is up-to-date with `staging`.
- Include descriptive commit messages.
- Request a review from at least one maintainer.
- Link the related issue (Bug/Feature/Workflow Gap/Task) in the PR description.

---

## Releases

- Releases are tagged from `main`.
- `staging` must be fully merged into `main` before tagging.

---

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the DCO to ensure that contributors have the right to submit their work. The full text is included in the `DCO` file at the repository root.

All commits must include a Signed-off-by line matching your Git author information. Use the `-s` flag when committing to add this automatically:

```
git commit -s -m "Add feature X"
```

If you forgot to sign off, amend the most recent commit:

```
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
```

For multiple commits, you can interactively rebase and sign each commit:

```
git rebase -i <base-branch>
# then for each commit: edit -> git commit --amend -s --no-edit -> git rebase --continue
```

Notes

- The Signed-off-by line must include your real name and a reachable email, for example:
  `Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>`
- Ensure your `git config user.name` and `user.email` are correct.
- Co-authored commits require a Signed-off-by for each author.
- The DCO check will run on pull requests; failures include instructions on how to fix your commits.

Enable global sign-off (recommended)

To automatically include a DCO sign-off on every commit from your machine, enable global sign-off:

```
git config --global format.signoff true
```

This works with most Git clients and IDEs (including VS Code) and reduces the chance of missing a sign-off.
