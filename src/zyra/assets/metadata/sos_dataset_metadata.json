    "title": "120 Years of Earthquakes and Their Tsunamis: 1901-2020",
    "description": "This animation shows every recorded earthquake in sequence as they occurred from January 1, 1901, through December 31, 2020, at a rate of 1 year per second. The earthquake hypocenters first appear as flashes then remain as colored circles before shrinking with time so as not to obscure subsequent earthquakes. The size of each circle represents the earthquake\u2019s magnitude while the color represents its depth within the earth. This animation also highlights significant tsunamis generated by some of these earthquakes. When the following earthquakes appear they will also have their tsunami\u2019s \u201cenergy map\u201d that shows each tsunami's maximum modeled wave heights on the open ocean:\n\n(*tsunami animation also available as part of SOS Tsunami Historical Series)\n\nNote that while the great majority of all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, these tsunami-causing earthquakes mostly occur at convergent plate boundaries. These boundaries, also called \u201csubduction zones,\u201d are where tectonic plates collide to produce megathrust earthquakes and are the regions where we expect future devastating tsunamis to come from. Other, much smaller earthquakes also occur away from plate boundaries such as those related to volcanic activity in Hawaii or those related to wastewater injection wells in Oklahoma.\n\nThe animation concludes with a series of summary maps. The first one shows all of the earthquakes in this 120-year period. The next map shows only those earthquakes known to have produced a tsunami, and the map after that shows only those earthquakes that produced damaging tsunamis. The final map shows the plate boundary faults responsible for the majority of these earthquakes.\n\nhe era of modern seismology\u2014the scientific study of earthquakes\u2014began with the invention of the seismograph in the late 19th Century and its deployment in instrument networks in the early 20th Century to record and measure earthquakes as they occur. Therefore, when the animation begins only the largest earthquakes will appear. They were the only ones that could be detected at great distances with the few instruments available at the time. But as time progressed, more and more seismographs were deployed and smaller and smaller earthquakes could be recorded. For example, the installation of these instruments in California in the 1930s creates the illusion of new earthquake activity there. Likewise, there appears to be a jump in the number of earthquakes globally in the 1970\u2019s when seismology took another leap forward with advances in telecommunications and digital signal processing, a trend that continues today.\n\nYouTube version: https://youtu.be/ilFEKSZQv5o\n\nSources:",

    "description": "A healthy, prosperous future for humanity rests not only on the shoulders of our leaders and policymakers, but also on the farmers and scientists who create the \"simple\" thing we need most: food.\n\nIn 2 Billion More Coming to Dinner, a young future farmer and her dad talk about how the old methods of farming achieved as much as they have, and how new techniques could be used to close the gap between how much food we have, and how much food we're going to need as global population approaches 9 billion. Between the fields and the farmhouse, the old farmer and the new teach, tease each other about their roles in feeding the biggest dinner party the planet has ever seen.\n\nHigh-resolution data gathered by the University of Minnesota's Institute on the Environment are rendered as spherical visualizations to show global cropland and pastureland extent, agricultural land devoted to food production and animal feed production, current agricultural productivity, and the gap between current yields and potential maximum yields, given sufficient water and fertilizer, and sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nAdditional datasets not incorporated into the film, but relevant to land use SoS programming, are also available. Downloadable visualizations include maps showing more detailed crop yield data, potential future yields, and global agricultural limiting factors (water, nutrients, and nutrients + water).

A Global Tour of Precipitation shows how rain and snowfall moves around the world from the vantage of space using measurements from the Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory, or GPM. This is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and offers the most detailed and worldwide view of rain and snowfall ever created.\n\nThis narrated movie will guide you through a variety of precipitation patterns and display features such as the persistent band of the heaviest rainfall around the equator and tight swirls of tropical storms in the Northern Hemisphere. At subtropical latitudes in both hemispheres there are persistent dry areas and this is where the majority of the major deserts reside. Sea surface temperatures and winds are shown to highlight the interconnectedness of the Earth system.\n\nThis show concludes with near-real time global precipitation data from GPM, which is provided to Science On a Sphere roughly six hours after the observation.\n\nThis video needs to be paired with the Precipitation \u2013 Real-time dataset, which should be played immediately after \u2018A Global Tour of Precipitation\u2019 video, to allow your audience to connect to current weather events that are happening.\n\nIt is encouraged to play the \u2018A Global Tour of Precipitation\u2019 video with z-rotation enabled to allow the audience to see the top and bottom of the sphere. The default speed of one rotation per minute is also recommended.\n\nLength of dataset: 3:50",

    "description": "Acidifying Oceans is a three-minute autorun film that features geologist Kevin Theissen at the University of St. Thomas explaining how humans are affecting the oceans, and what the threat is to our global oceans. The show is built around a dataset showing ocean acidification from 1884 to the present, and then projects levels out to the end of the current century. Dr. Theissen connects this global threat to his individual research on sequestering carbon, demonstrating the connection between large-scale challenges and individual research efforts.\n\nAcidifying Oceans is one in a series of four SOS films that use data visualizations and actual scientists to tell stories about the impacts of climate change. No other single natural factor affects Earth as much as humans now do. Separately, each film stands alone, focusing on a single area of human impact, and features a researcher working in this area. Together, the films tell a bigger story about the human-generated effects of global climate change.\n\nThis movie is available in English and Spanish.\n\nLength of dataset: 3:12",

    "description": "With so many uncertainties attached to climate change, it is important to look at all of the factors. As early as 1896, scientists have been analyzing the presence of black carbon in the atmosphere. This group of three datasets looks at the presence of aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere. The first dataset contains only black carbon optical thickness, the second has sulfate optical thickness and the third has a combination of both black carbon and sulfate optical thickness. The data is from January 31, 2007 and extends out 120 hours through February 4, 2007. Black carbon is commonly known as soot. It is generated from burning fossil fuels and biomass fuels. Soot is the result of incomplete combustion, especially of coal, diesel fuels, biofuels and other biomass burnings. Sulfate is the result of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide interacting with other compounds in the atmosphere. Sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere are associated with the combustion of fossil fuels and also the eruption of volcanoes like Mt. Pinatubo.\n\nA large source of black carbon is from China and India, where most cooking and heating are done with wood, coal, and other biofuels at a low temperature that hinders that complete combustion of the compounds. Both black carbon and sulfate affect the global temperature by interacting with sunlight. It is thought that the presence of sulfate lowers the total mean global temperature by reflecting away incoming solar radiation. Conversely, black carbon absorbs the sunlight that reaches it, causing the air temperature to rise. This rise in air temperature causes convection and has been proven to change the hydrological cycle. Some flooding in China has been blamed on the high presence of black carbon. The Northern Hemisphere produces many more aerosols than the Southern Hemisphere largely because there are more people living in the Northern Hemisphere.",

    "title": "Aerosols: Black Carbon and Sulfate",
    "description": "With so many uncertainties attached to climate change, it is important to look at all of the factors. As early as 1896, scientists have been analyzing the presence of black carbon in the atmosphere. This group of three datasets looks at the presence of aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere. The first dataset contains only black carbon optical thickness, the second has sulfate optical thickness and the third has a combination of both black carbon and sulfate optical thickness. The data is from January 31, 2007 and extends out 120 hours through February 4, 2007. Black carbon is commonly known as soot. It is generated from burning fossil fuels and biomass fuels. Soot is the result of incomplete combustion, especially of coal, diesel fuels, biofuels and other biomass burnings. Sulfate is the result of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide interacting with other compounds in the atmosphere. Sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere are associated with the combustion of fossil fuels and also the eruption of volcanoes like Mt. Pinatubo.\n\nA large source of black carbon is from China and India, where most cooking and heating are done with wood, coal, and other biofuels at a low temperature that hinders that complete combustion of the compounds. Both black carbon and sulfate affect the global temperature by interacting with sunlight. It is thought that the presence of sulfate lowers the total mean global temperature by reflecting away incoming solar radiation. Conversely, black carbon absorbs the sunlight that reaches it, causing the air temperature to rise. This rise in air temperature causes convection and has been proven to change the hydrological cycle. Some flooding in China has been blamed on the high presence of black carbon. The Northern Hemisphere produces many more aerosols than the Southern Hemisphere largely because there are more people living in the Northern Hemisphere.",

    "description": "The Flow Following Finite Volume Icosahedral Model (FIM) was developed by NOAA to produce weather forecasts. In fact, weather forecasts from the FIM model are available for SOS here. Building upon the success of the FIM model, the FIM-Chem model was created. The FIM-Chem is the FIM model with chemistry and aerosol modules added. Aerosols are one of the biggest uncertainties in climate models due to their varied affects on radiation and cloud physics. The FIM-Chem allows researchers to forecast and study the behavior of aerosols in the atmosphere, leading to the potential for better Earth system modeling for climate prediction.\n\nIn this dataset, the FIM-Chem model is used to trace the presence of three aerosols from August 27, 2009 through September 7, 2009. Green shading is dust, red shading is black carbon aerosols and blue is organic carbon aerosols. When there are multiple aerosols present in one location, the color for the aerosols is combined. The two types of carbon often occur together, though in different proportions. Areas of anthropogenic emissions tend to have a redder color while areas of burning, such as wildfires, tend to have a more purplish-pink color because the ratio of organic carbons to black carbons varies for the two emissions sources. Wildfires have a high ratio of organic carbon to black carbon.\n\nDuring the time period of this dataset there were wildfires in California, Alaska and British Columbia and biomass burning in Sub-Equatorial Africa and the Amazon region. The white shading is from the presence of all three aerosols. This can be seen in southern Europe where the anthropogenic emissions from Europe are mixing with the dry, dusty air in the Sahara.",

    "title": "Age of the Seafloor",
    "description": "The surface of the Earth is composed of a mosaic of tectonic plates with edges that create fault lines. The Earth's crust is made of seven major plates and several smaller plates. As the plates move, new sea floor can be created. The plates form three different kinds of boundaries: convergent, divergent, and transform. Convergent boundaries are also called collision boundaries because they are areas where two plates collide. At transform boundaries, the plates slide and grind past one another. The divergent boundaries are the areas where plates are moving apart from one another. Where plates move apart, new crustal material is formed from molten magma from below the Earth's surface. Because of this, the youngest sea floor can be found along divergent boundaries, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Ridge. The spreading, however, is generally not uniform causing linear features perpendicular to the divergent boundaries, shown in this dataset as contour lines.\n\nThis dataset shows the age of the ocean floor with the lines or contours of 5 million years as shown in the colorbar. Plate names and plate boundaries are available as layers but must be turned on to appear. The data is from four companion digital models of the age, age uncertainty, spreading rates and spreading asymmetries of the world's ocean basins. Scientists use the magnetic polarity of the sea floor to determine the age. Very little of the sea floor is older than 150 million years. This is because the oldest sea floor is subducted under other plates and replaces by new surfaces. The tectonic plates are constantly in motion and new surfaces are always being created. This continual motion is evidenced by the occurrence of earthquakes and volcanoes.\n\nThe NOAA NCEI data was accessed from Esri ArcGIS Living Atlas and recolored using ArcGIS Pro (for a free alternative use QGIS)",

Pastureland is land used for raising and grazing animals. Altogether, cropland covers about 16 million square kilometers, an area of land approximately the size of South America. Global pastureland occupies more than 30 million square kilometers, about the area of Africa.\n\nCumulatively, agricultural land covers about 40% of the Earth\u2019s land surface, and the vast majority of its arable land. Creating additional farmlands would require the destruction of other ecosystems, such as the tropical rainforests. Touched on briefly in 2 Billion More Coming to Dinner, talking points could revolve around the value of food production versus the value of the ecosystem services provided by rainforests, intensification of agriculture compared to agricultural expansion, and what the long term repercussions of each strategy might be.",

Potential yield for a given area is determined by using the productivity of another region with analogous environmental conditions and optimized water and nutrient input as a benchmark. In both maps, darker areas show smaller yields, while bright pink areas indicate higher yields.\n\nThe production gap map highlights the difference between current and potential yields. While some regions may have a very high potential yield, it may already be nearly equaled by their current yields. (See the American Midwest for areas that are producing very near to their full potential.) Regions with greater room for improvement, however, stand out in bright yellow on the yield gap map. Bright spots in Asia, West Africa, Eastern Europe and Central America, for instance, indicate locations where significantly more food can be produced.",

This map shows which regions produce crops that are mostly consumed directly by humans (in green), which regions produce about the same amount of human food and animal feed (in orange), and where most of the crops are used as animal feed (in red).\n\nAs discussed in 2 Billion More Coming to Dinner , the conversion of crops to meat is not particularly efficient (in the case of cattle, for example, about 30 pounds of feed are needed to grow a single pound of beef), so as global demand for meat rises, cropland devoted to growing animal feed will have to increase proportionately. What effect will this have on the cost of meat, crops, and our diets?",

    "description": "These visualizations, created by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Institute on the Environment, show the global land use intensity for pastureland and cropland.Cropland is land devoted to growing plants for humans use for food, material, or fuel. Pastureland is land used for raising and grazing animals. Altogether, cropland covers about 16 million square kilometers, an area of land approximately the size of South America. Global pastureland occupies more than 30 million square kilometers, about the area of Africa.\n\nCumulatively, agricultural land covers about 40% of the Earth\u2019s land surface, and the vast majority of its arable land. Creating additional farmlands would require the destruction of other ecosystems, such as the tropical rainforests. Touched on briefly in 2 Billion More Coming to Dinner, talking points could revolve around the value of food production versus the value of the ecosystem services provided by rainforests, intensification of agriculture compared to agricultural expansion, and what the long term repercussions of each strategy might be.",

    "description": "This is a mosaic of the images covering the entire sky as observed by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), part of its All-Sky Data Release.\n\nThis map is centered on the Milky Way, our own galaxy, with the plane of the galaxy running along the equator. The Milky Way is shaped like a disk and the Solar System is located in that disk about two-thirds of the way out from the center. So we see the Milky Way as a band running through the sky. As we look toward the center of the Galaxy we are looking through more of the disk than when we are looking at large angles away from the center, and you can see a noticeable increase in stars (colored blue-green).\n\nAt high Galactic latitudes - the northern and southern hemispheres on the sphere - many of the individual specks and smudges of light are distant galaxies, while others are stars in our neighborhood of the Milky Way. Particularly prominent in the southern hemisphere are the Large and Small Magellanic \"Clouds,\" galactic neighbors of our own Milky Way galaxy. A helpful finder diagram can be found here.\n\nThere are some artifacts worth noting in the image. For the WISE image atlas, moving objects such as asteroids and comets were removed. However, some slower moving, bright objects, including the planets Saturn, Mars and Jupiter, did leave behind residuals. In addition, at several locations on the sphere there are small rectangular shaped features that result from the difficulty in matching background levels of individual atlas frames.\n\nThree of the four wavelengths surveyed by WISE were used to create this image. The colors used in this image represent specific wavelengths of infrared light. Cyan (blue-green) represents light emitted predominantly from stars and galaxies at a wavelength of 3.4 microns. Green and red represent light mostly emitted by dust at 12 and 22 microns, respectively.",

    "description": "Uranus has 27 moons, all of which are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five main satellites, in order of proximity to Uranus, are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Before the Voyager 2 studied Uranus in 1986, these five moons were the only ones known to exist.\n\nAriel (a character in The Tempest by Shakespeare and also a character in a Pope poem) is the brightest moon of Uranus. The most notable features on this moon are the craters that cover the surface as well as the interconnected rift valleys that run across the moon. Some of the valleys are up to 6 miles deep.",

    "description": "Models create a dynamic portrait of the Earth through numerical experiments that simulate our current knowledge of the dynamical and physical processes governing weather and climate variability. The simulation visualized here captures how winds lift up aerosols from the Earth\u2019s surface and transport them around the globe during the period September 1, 2006 to March 17, 2007. Such simulations allow scientists to identify the sources and pathways of these tiny particulates that influence weather and climate.\n\nWith a resolution of 10 kilometers per grid cell, the simulation represents a variety of features worldwide. Dust (red) blows over the Saharan desert and interacts with two Atlantic tropical cyclones. Sea salt (blue) churned up from the ocean by surface winds is most prevalent along mid-latitude storm tracks and fronts in the Southern Ocean and within tropical cyclones. Organic and black carbon (green) burst from extensive biomass burning in South America and Africa. Sulfate (white) arises from three primary sources: fossil fuel emissions over Asia, Europe, and the United States; a persistently active volcano in Mozambique, Africa; and a large eruption from the Karthala Volcano on Grande Comore Island, Comoros, in January 2007.\n\nThe simulation used the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) and the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) Model. It ran on 3,750 processors of the Discover supercomputer at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation.\n\nGEOS-5 development is funded by NASA\u2019s Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program.",

    "title": "Aurora",
    "description": "Galileo first used the term to describe the light. Aurora is the Roman goddess of dawn.\n\nThe Greek name for the north wind (Boreas). In the southern hemisphere it is called Aurora Australis.\n\nThe light in the upper atmosphere is caused by energetic electrons zipping down the magnetic field lines of Earth and colliding with the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere (primarily O and N2). When the electrons collide with the atmosphere, they transfer momentum energy into excited states of the atom or molecule. When the atoms and molecules relax back to their ground state they release photons that we can see.\n\nThe most common color is a pale yellowish green. This color occurs at a very specific wavelength (557.7 nm). It is produced by atomic oxygen. Another common color, is a red glow at 630.0 nm, which is also produced by oxygen. Sometimes the lower edges of aurora rays can be a bluish purple (427.8 nm) from molecular nitrogen. And if you see aurora near sunrise or sunset, the sunlight hits the tops of the auroral rays and ionizes the excited nitrogen to create a purple color. There are many other colors in the aurora but they are either too dim to see with the naked eye or they are outside the visible spectrum, either in the infrared or ultraviolet (where the human eye can't see them).\n\nThe process of accelerating electrons into the atmosphere starts at the sun. When the sun is active (near solar maximum), it can eject large blobs of plasma called Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). A CME is a billion tons of material traveling at up to 2000 km/sec (or 4.5 million miles/hour). If the CME is directed toward Earth, it will take one to three days for it to travel the 150 million km (96 million miles) from sun to Earth. When it reaches Earth, the magnetic field of Earth deflects much of the CME around Earth but some of the more energetic particles can enter the Earth's magnetic field or Magnetosphere. Even though much of the mass is deflected around Earth, the impact can jar the magnetosphere and shake it up, causing it to change configuration. All of this shaking and reconfiguring can accelerate electrons that are normally trapped within the magnetosphere. The accelerated electrons are still confined to follow the magnetic field lines of Earth but now they travel down the field line and collide with the atmosphere. Early scientists made the connection between an increase in sunspots (active regions on the sun) and an increase in the intensity and frequency of the aurora.\n\nDuring solar minimum, when CMEs are less likely, it is still possible to have a strong aurora. A feature on the sun called a coronal hole is associated with strong background solar wind. Normally the solar wind flows about 300-500 km/sec but from a coronal hole, the solar wind can flow to 800 km/sec. This increase in solar wind speed can also cause the magnetosphere to reconfigure, the electrons to get accelerated, and aurora to form. These auroral displays are less dramatic than those associated with CMEs but they can still be quite spectacular if you are in the right place at the right time.\n\nWhen CMEs hit the magnetosphere or when strong solar wind from a coronal hole shakes the magnetosphere, it causes the magnetic field to change and reconfigure. Magnetic field lines can break and reconnect which can in turn accelerate electrons. All of these changes result in a change in the magnetic field of Earth. If you hold a magnetic compass very still during a strong geomagnetic storm, you might observe the needle to move around. One of the consequences of this is that migratory birds that use Earth's magnetic field to know where to fly, will lose their way. Pigeon racers know about this and will not let their pigeons fly during big geomagnetic storms.\n\nGeomagnetic storms are ranked on a scale of 0 to 9 with 9 being the largest. This is called the planetary K index or Kp. During a typical 11 year solar cycle there might be two to four geomagnetic storms that reach Kp = 9.\n\nBecause the aurora is trapped on the magnetic field lines, it is most often seen near the north and south poles of Earth. Because of the structure of the magnetosphere, and the primary acceleration processes in the tail part of the magnetosphere (away from the sun), aurora form a ring or oval around each of the poles of Earth and are brightest and most dramatic near midnight. The auroral ovals are not centered on the geographic pole but are centered on the magnetic pole of Earth. On nights where there is little geomagnetic activity and the aurora is quiet, it stays further poleward. But when activity picks up, it becomes brighter and the auroral oval expands towards the equator. During very large events, it is possible to see the aurora in the continental US.\n\nIt should be noted that the aurora is symmetric and auroral features in the northern hemisphere are mirrored in the southern hemisphere.\n\nHere are several suggestions on what to consider when looking for aurora. First it must be dark. Traveling to the polar regions in the summer won't work because the sun is up 24 hours a day. Second, it must be clear. Often coastal regions are cloudy, so going someplace away from the oceans improves probabilities of seeing aurora. Third, it is good to get away from other sources of light such as cities, streetlights, and even the full moon. Fourth, you should stay up and watch for aurora between 10 PM and 1 AM local time. That is when the aurora is the brightest and most active. And finally, it is good to have some geomagnetic activity. The aurora is visible somewhere on Earth nearly all the time. But it is usually just a few faint arcs that do not move or change very much. Geomagnetic activity will cause the aurora to get brighter, to move further towards the equator, and to become more active.\n\nYou can see the aurora from space. The astronauts on the International Space Station see the aurora all the time and actually fly through the aurora on occasion. There is also aurora on other planets. Jupiter and Saturn have regular auroral displays.\n\nImage Caption\nSecond Line\n\nThis SOS sequence is layered over the Earth at Night dataset and shows the output from the OVATION Prime model of the aurora. It represents the approximate location and intensity of the aurora over a 24 hour period. Each frame is five minutes. This sequence captures a moderate sized geomagnetic storm (reaching 7 on a scale of 0 to 9). The OVATION Prime model uses the speed of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field. The solar wind takes 20 to 50 minutes to travel from the L1 point to Earth, where it is observed, so this model provides a forecast of the aurora with 20-50 minute lead time. This model was developed by P.Newell at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. It is being run in real time at the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and the displays and web page are produced by the Space Weather Prediction Center. You can see this model in realtime at helios.swpc.noaa.gov/ovation.\n\nAs this sequence plays there are several things to notice. 1) the aurora is usually brightest near midnight. 2) The auroral oval extends into the dayside part of Earth but you cannot see the aurora during the day. As the auroral activity picks up, the auroral oval expands equatorward. 3). The auroral oval is centered on the geomagnetic pole, not the geographic pole.",

These auroral displays are less dramatic than those associated with CMEs but they can still be quite spectacular if you are in the right place at the right time.\n\nWhen CMEs hit the magnetosphere or when strong solar wind from a coronal hole shakes the magnetosphere, it causes the magnetic field to change and reconfigure. Magnetic field lines can break and reconnect which can in turn accelerates electrons. All of these changes result in a change in the magnetic field of Earth. If you hold a magnetic compass very still during a strong geomagnetic storm, you might observe the needle moving around. One of the consequences of this is that migratory birds that use Earth's magnetic field to know where to fly, will lose their way. Pigeon racers know about this and will not let their pigeons fly during big geomagnetic storms.\n\nGeomagnetic storms are ranked on a scale of 0 to 9 with 9 being the largest. This is called the planetary K index or Kp. During a typical 11 year solar cycle there might be two to four geomagnetic storms that reach Kp = 9.\n\nBecause the aurora is trapped on the magnetic field lines, it is most often seen near the north and south poles of Earth. Because of the structure of the magnetosphere, and the primary acceleration processes in the tail part of the magnetosphere (away from the sun), aurora form a ring or oval around each of the poles of Earth and are brightest and most dramatic near midnight. The auroral ovals are not centered on the geographic pole but are centered on the magnetic pole of Earth. On nights where there is little geomagnetic activity and the aurora is quiet, it stays further poleward. But when activity picks up, it becomes brighter and the auroral oval expands towards the equator. During very large events, it is possible to see the aurora in the continental US.\n\nIt should be noted that the aurora is symmetric and auroral features in the northern hemisphere are mirrored in the southern hemisphere.\n\nHere are several suggestions on what to consider when looking for aurora. First it must be dark. Traveling to the polar regions in the summer won't work because the sun is up 24 hours a day. Second, it must be clear. Often coastal regions are cloudy so going someplace away from the oceans improves probabilities of seeing aurora. Third, it is good to get away from other sources of light such as cities, streetlights, and even the full moon. Fourth, you should stay up and watch for aurora between 10 PM and 1 AM local time. That is when the aurora is the brightest and most active. And finally, it is good to have some geomagnetic activity. The aurora is visible somewhere on Earth nearly all the time. But it is usually just a few faint arcs that do not move or change very much. Geomagnetic activity will cause the aurora to get brighter, to move further towards the equator, and to become more active.\n\nYou can see the aurora from space. The astronauts on the International Space Station see the aurora all the time and actually fly through the aurora on occasion. There is also aurora on other planets. Jupiter and Saturn have regular auroral displays.\n\nImage Caption\nSecond Line\n\nThis SOS sequence is layered over the Earth at Night dataset and shows the output from the OVATION Prime model of the aurora. It represents the approximate location and intensity of the aurora over a 24 hour period. Each frame is five minutes. This sequence captures a moderate sized geomagnetic storm (reaching 7 on a scale of 0 to 9). The OVATION Prime model uses the speed of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field. The solar wind takes 20 to 50 minutes to travel from the L1 point to Earth, where it is observed, so this model provides a forecast of the aurora with 20-50 minute lead time. This model was developed by P.Newell at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. It is being run in real time at the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and the displays and web page are produced by the Space Weather Prediction Center. You can see this model in realtime at helios.swpc.noaa.gov/ovation.\n\nAs this sequence plays there are several things to notice. 1) the aurora is usually brightest near midnight. 2) The auroral oval extends into the dayside part of Earth but you cannot see the aurora during the day. As the auroral activity picks up, the auroral oval expands equatorward. 3). The auroral oval is centered on the geomagnetic pole, not the geographic pole.",

    "description": "The term biosphere refers to the regions of the surface, atmosphere, and hydrosphere of the earth occupied by living organisms.This dataset shows quantity of marine plant-life as it changes throughout the seasons of the year.\n\n\"The purpose of the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Project is to provide quantitative data on global, ocean bio-optical, properties to the Earth science community. Subtle changes in ocean color signify various types and quantities of marine phytoplankton (microscopic marine plants), the knowledge of which has both scientific and practical applications.\" - SeaWiFS website. The SeaWiFS Project collects, processes, and distributes data received from an ocean color sensor orbiting the Earth on a satellite. The orbiting sensor can view every square kilometer of cloud-free ocean every 48 hours, providing global information on the oceans. The satellite observations can be used to derive the concentration of microscopic marine plants, phytoplankton, based on the color of the ocean.\n\nThe oceans are shaded based on the chlorophyll (green pigment in plants) concentration. Greener water signifies an abundance of phytoplankton, while bluer water indicates less. Red patches in the ocean often occur at the mouth of a major river and indicate an abundance of life caused by run-off containing higher concentrations of fertilizers and other nutrients that find their way into the water source.\n\nKnowing where plant-life in both the ocean and on land is abundant is important to scientists because plants remove carbon from the atmosphere.The ability to continuously monitor biological activity with SeaWiFS helps scientists to understand the role of the ocean in the global carbon cycle, as well as other interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere.\n\nThis version of SeaWiFS shows the land as a still image, only the changes in the ocean through the year are seen to fluctuate.",

    "description": "This animation shows the daily concentration of ocean surface chlorophyll as simulated by the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) with an embedded marine ecosystem model. While POP calculates the ocean currents, temperature and salinity, the ecosystem model simulates the complex interaction of microscopic marine plants (chlorophyll-containing phytoplankton), animals (zooplankton) and nutrients (such as nitrogen, phosphorus and iron). In addition to constituting a major part of the global food web, phytoplankton remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via photosynthesis much like their counterparts on land. As conditions in the ocean and atmosphere change due to increased carbon emissions, it is important to be able to use these kinds of models to understand the possible effects on life in the ocean and the global carbon cycle.\n\nIn the animation, the seasonal cycle of the phytoplankton bloom is clearly seen (greens and yellows) as the sun stimulates photosynthesis. The vast subtropical areas that never experience a strong bloom (blue hues) demonstrate that it is necessary for more than just sunlight to produce a bloom. In these regions, the ocean and atmospheric conditions combine to deprive the water of crucial nutrients necessary for photosynthesis. In contrast, the equatorial regions experience year-round blooms due to the steady supply of nutrients from below the sea surface provided by the ocean circulation. Near the poles, photosynthesis is almost completely shut down when there is sea ice present (magenta).",

    "description": "This dataset shows the migration of 118 species of terrestrial bird populations in the Western Hemisphere. Each dot represents the estimated location of the center of each species\u2019 population for each day of the year. These estimations come from millions of observations from the eBird citizen-science database. eBird is a real-time, online checklist program, launched in 2002 by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and National Audubon Society, that allows birdwatchers to enter their observations.\n\nThe colors in this dataset represent the average daily air temperature at the surface, calculated from observations from 1981-2010. The yellow and red colors represent warmer air, while blues show areas below freezing.\n\nA recent study that explored these trajectories, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found broad similarities in the routes used by specific groups of species. A key finding from the study is that bird species that head out over the Atlantic Ocean during autumn migration to spend winter in the Caribbean and South America follow a clockwise looped trajectory and take a path farther inland on their return journey in the spring. Species that follow this broad pattern include Bobolinks, Yellow and Black-billed cuckoos, Connecticut and Cape May warblers, Bicknell\u2019s Thrush, and shorebirds, such as the American Golden Plover. These looped pathways help the birds take advantage of more favorable winds during spring and autumn migration. For species that do not fly over the open ocean, the study finds that many use the same migration routes in the spring and fall. Geographic features shaping this pattern include mountain chains or isthmuses that funnel migrants along narrow routes. Additional details on the 118 species can be found here.",

    "description": "The Earth has been through many changes and continues to change today. To better understand these changes, the Z\u00fcrich University of Applied Sciences created past and future simulations using past climate data, observations, and computer models. The simulation starts 21,000 years ago and ends 8,000 years in the future, showing the changes in ice concentration, sea level, and vegetation. 19,000BC was chosen as the start date because this was the last glacial maximum, when the Earth's ice sheets were at their maximum extension. As seen in the animation, much of northern Europe and North America were covered in ice in 19,000BC. The labels for the animation include information about carbon dioxide concentration, average temperature, sea level and population. The red line indicates the current levels. The yellow borders on the map represent the current coastlines. The data from 19,000BC to 2,000AD includes the most up-to-date paleoclimate data that is available. Some notable events in the past simulation include:\n\nFor the time frame from 2,000AD to 3,000AD, a computer model based on the IPCC A2 scenario was used. This scenario assumes a complete cessation of carbon dioxide emissions in 2100. More details on the model used can be found here. In this part of the simulation the time steps change from a frame every 500 years as used in the first part of the animation, to a frame every 50 years to show the rapid changes that are modeled. The northern ice cap quickly disappears and the ice on Greenland and Antarctica begins to melt steadily. By the year 3,000AD, there is predicted 6m (19ft) sea level rise. The simulation continues from 3,000AD to 10,000 AD in 500 year time steps in a fictional scenario of worldwide glacier meltdown and shows the impacts this would have on the coasts.\n\nThe Zurich University of Applied Sciences has also made this animation available for Google Earth:",

Each dot on this visualization represents a buoy or float, and each color indicates the use of the instrument. The buoy network is still expanding past what can be seen on this visualization.\n\nThe green colored dots are floats in the Argo network. By the end of 2006, 3000 Argo floats are scheduled to be located worldwide. These are deep-water floats that record continuous data from over 6500ft below sea level up to the surface. The yellow and blue dots are maintained by NOAA. These include both traditional buoys, but also C-MAN (Coastal-Marine Automated Network) stations. Most of the buoys are located off of the shores of the United States and provide data for the NOAA Marine Environmental Buoy Database. The C-MAN stations are located on piers, offshore towers, lighthouses, and beaches. These buoys and stations record parameters such as wind speed and direction, wave height, pressure, air temperature, and sea surface temperature. The red dots are buoys in the Deep Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) Project, which is an ongoing effort to maintain and improve the capability for the early detection and real-time reporting of tsunamis in the open ocean. Finally, the purple dots are buoys used in the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean, TAO/TRITON, project. This project is dedicated to El Nino and La Nina. Notice that the buoys are arranged in parallel lines in the ocean where this phenomenon tends to occur.",

Callisto, the second largest moon of Jupiter, is the only body its size in the solar system that has had no resurfacing since its original impacts left their mark.\n\nThe largest craters on the surface of Callisto are surrounded by concentric rings which appear as cracks, but have smoothed out some with age. At nearly 1900 miles in diameter, Valhalla, the largest crater on Callisto, is a good example of a crater surrounded by concentric rings. The icy crust of Callisto has smoothed out some with age, the result being that there are no impressive mountains and the craters are not as deep as one might suspect. In fact, it is believed that the largest craters have been diminished by the flow of the ice across the surface over time.",

    "description": "Models create a dynamic portrait of the Earth through numerical experiments that simulate our current knowledge of the dynamical and physical processes governing weather and climate variability. This new simulation of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere provides an ultra-high-resolution look at how the key greenhouse gas moves around the globe and fluctuates in volume throughout the year. These three close-up views show how local geography affects the transport of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nThe visualization is a product of a NASA computer model called GEOS-5, created by scientists with the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. This particular simulation has about 64 times greater resolution than most global climate models. In particular, the simulation is called a Nature Run. In this kind of simulation, real data on emissions and atmospheric conditions is ingested by the model, which is then left to run on its own to simulate the behavior of Earth's atmosphere for a two-year period - in this case, May 2005 to June 2007.\n\nThe colors represent a range of carbon dioxide concentrations, from 375 (dark blue) to 395 (light purple) parts per million. The red represents about 385 parts per million. White plumes represent carbon monoxide emissions.\n\nNorth American Emissions: One of the visually striking things about this animation is how much local weather patterns affect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In this close-up view of North America - from Feb. 1, 2006 to Mar. 1, 2006 in the simulation - you can see the major emissions sources in the U.S. Midwest and along the East Coast. As the carbon dioxide is emitted, westerly winds created by the warm currents of the Gulf Stream carry the greenhouse gas eastward over the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAsia and the Himalayas: In this view of Asia, two things stand out: the major emissions sources of the industrialized Asian countries, and the natural barrier of the Himalayas. As carbon dioxide concentrations swirl and move eastward, the Himalayas - the crescent-shaped mountain range just north of India - redirect winds. This video shows Feb. 1, 2006 to Mar. 1, 2006 from the simulation.\n\nAfrican fires: While the previous movies showed regions of major man-made emissions, this close-up shows the emission of carbon dioxide - and carbon monoxide, the plumes of white - from fires in southern Africa. This video shows Aug. 1, 2006 to Sept. 1, 2006, a period of seasonal burning in this region.\n\nFor more information, click here.",

    "description": "This SOS dataset is a companion to a flat-screen data visualization, Keeling's Curve: The Story of CO2, produced by the American Museum of Natural History's Science Bulletins program.\n\nMore than 60 years ago, scientists were uncertain how much carbon dioxide was present in the atmosphere: measurements were taken sporadically, and published values varied widely. In 1957, the U.S. Weather Bureau (now called the National Weather Service) built Mauna Loa Observatory. The facility's remote location near the summit of Hawaii's 4,000-meter-high volcano offered access to air undisturbed by industry and other polluting factors.\n\nThere, a young researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography named Charles (Dave) Keeling, who in years prior had developed accurate means to measure the gas, began the CO2 measuring program that persists to this day. Keeling's air samples revealed not only carbon dioxide's natural short-term cycles but also a long-term rise forced by human activity.\n\nMauna Loa Observatory is now a part of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL). It continues to monitor greenhouse and ozone-depleting gases to aid research and understanding of global climate and atmospheric change.\n\nThis dataset shows the annual cycle of CO2 in the atmosphere that Keeling discovered: the distinct rise and fall of carbon dioxide levels over a year's time. The data are from January 1 to December 31, 2012.\n\nOn the graph are daily average atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements recorded at Mauna Loa Observatory. The unit is parts per million, or ppm - the number of CO2 molecules present in every million molecules of air. The annual pattern is caused by the uptake and release of CO2 from seasonal plant growth on the vast landmasses of the Northern Hemisphere. The annual maximum CO2 concentration in the Northern Hemisphere occurs around May. The spring buildup happens because decaying plants have been releasing carbon throughout the winter. The annual minimum concentration occurs around October, after new growth has withdrawn CO2 from the air during photosynthesis.\n\nMapped onto the globe is CarbonTracker, a global model of how CO2 moves across the atmosphere. CarbonTracker was developed by NOAA ESRL. It simulates CO2 concentrations around the world based on observed quantities collected at Mauna Loa and other sampling sites (white dots). CarbonTracker also takes into account how molecules move through the atmosphere. On this map of CarbonTracker data, CO2 's spring buildup in the Northern Hemisphere is distinctly visible as a purple band on the top half of the globe in May. The Southern Hemisphere shows low levels (yellow) at that time. For more on CarbonTracker, see these datasets:\n\nDuring Keeling's first measurements in 1958, the maximum concentration of CO2 reached 318 ppm in late May. In time, he realized that CO2 's annual cycles were superimposed on a long-term trend: average CO2 levels were rising 2.2 percent a year. He attributed this rise to the addition of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and recognized its implications for enhancing the greenhouse effect. In 2013, CO2 levels at Mauna Loa Observatory reached 400 ppm for several days, a long-expected symbolic milestone of the human impact on Earth's atmosphere. In 2014, levels exceeded 400 ppm daily for three months straight.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nNOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, Global Monitoring Division\n\nScripps Institution of Oceanography: The Keeling Curve\n\nCharles David Keeling biography\n\nNew York Times: A Scientist, His Work, and a Climate Reckoning\n\nNOAA Climate.gov: Climate Change - Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide\n\nClimate Central: 400 ppm - A Milestone That Means Everything, and Nothing",

    "description": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most prevalent greenhouse gas driving global climate change. However, its increase in the atmosphere would be even more rapid without land and ocean carbon sinks, which collectively absorb about half of human emissions every year. Advanced computer modeling techniques in NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office allow us to disentangle the influences of sources and sinks and to better understand where carbon is coming from and going to.\n\nThis visualization shows the CO2 being added to Earth's atmosphere over the course of the year 2021, split into four major contributors: fossil fuels in orange, burning biomass in red, land ecosystems in green, and the ocean in blue. The dots on the surface represent atmospheric carbon dioxide being absorbed by land ecosystems in green and by the ocean in blue. Though the land and oceans are each carbon sinks in a global sense, individual locations can be sources at different times.\n\nFor example, in North America and South America, during the growing season plants absorb CO2 through photosynthesis, but release much of this carbon through respiration during winter months. Some interesting features include fossil fuel emissions from the northeastern urban corridor that extends from Washington D.C. to Boston in the United States. The fast oscillation over the Amazon rainforest shows the impact of plants absorbing carbon while the sun is shining and then releasing it back into the atmosphere during nighttime hours.\n\nIn Asia, the most notable feature is fossil fuel emissions from China, which contribute to the increasing atmospheric burden of CO2 over the course of 2021. In contrast, drawdown from the land biosphere is visible over Australia for much of the year because emissions and population density are much lower. By the end of the animation, fossil fuel emissions which are released predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere are mixing southward obscuring Australia.\n\nIn Europe, fossil fuel emissions are visible in orange, while red representing emissions from fires is visible over central Africa, where fire is used to clear crop residue. Fires represent a much smaller source of CO2 to the atmosphere than fossil fuel emissions, but are significant because they can alter the ability of an ecosystem to sequester carbon in the future. Scientists are carefully monitoring how CO2 emissions from fires are altered by climate change, which is bringing longer and more severe fire seasons to many areas.\n\nThis dataset was created for SOS by the NASA Scientific Visualization Studio from a volumetric version that they originally created.",

    "description": "The Global Monitoring Division at NOAA diligently monitors carbon dioxide and other trace gases in the atmosphere. One of the methods they use to sample trace gases is collecting flasks of air from around the world that can be tested. They have several other means for collecting samples as well. In this data set, the NOAA GMD sampling network as of 2005 is portrayed. Circles are flask sampling locations, stars are aircraft sites (12 flasks per flight are filled) and ships, which are only visible as they race from Australia and New Zealand to the US west coast or Japan, or from Cape Town to the US east coast. The coloration in the dataset represents the fluxes constructed by the ocean, biosphere, and fossil fuel modules of the NOAA ESRL data assimilation system for CO2 and related trace gases. The data set shows daily average fluxes constructed from 3-hour model output.\n\nSeasonally, the CO2 fluxes go through a cycle where respiration by the biosphere dominates over photosynthesis (winter, red colors), to one where photosynthesis is stronger than respiration (summer, green colors). The passage of fronts usually leads to red colors in the movie, as reduced sunlight reduces photosynthesis leading to net emissions. In late fall, high temperatures in the southern US combined with droughts leads to 'stressed' vegetation (red colors), reducing photosynthesis and thus also net emissions of CO2. The ocean fluxes mostly show a coarse pattern of CO2 concentrations in sea water, which is determined by large scale ocean circulation. Cold, CO2 rich water is brought to the surface in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, while the downward transport of warm, CO2 poor water occurs in the extra-tropics in the North Atlantic. In this dataset, the pattern and magnitude of fossil fuel CO2 fluxes is prescribed based on EPA estimates. They show up as red spots in locations of major cities.",

    "title": "Carbon Monoxide - 2008 - 2011",
    "description": "Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas existing in the atmosphere at levels between 40 and 150 parts per billion (ppb). About 40% of that is produced by burning (combustion) of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) and biomass (for example, wood in forest fires). CO is the primary consumer of oxidant OH, the \"cleansing agent\" of the atmosphere. For example, OH \"cleanses the air\" by converting atmospheric methane (CH4) to CO2, which reduces its global warming potential because methane is a stronger greenhouse gas. OH also breaks down a whole host of other compounds such as benzene, isoprene and halocarbons, which would otherwise give rise to smog and reduce air quality. Therefore, an excess of atmospheric CO leads to a reduction of OH's cleansing capacity. Another reason for measuring CO concentrations is that it is an indicator of combustion, such as forest fires and urban emissions. A large forest fire or emissions from heavy traffic can produce CO concentrations of 200 - 5000 ppb.\n\nCareful measurements of CO concentrations in the global atmosphere have been made by NOAA ESRL for decades. In conjunction with other high quality surface and satellite-based measurements these observations have allowed scientists to study the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere (via CO's interaction with OH), combustion arising from forest fires, and the effectiveness of policies designed to reduce CO as a pollutant. A computer model of the atmosphere called TM5 was used to create this powerful visualization. TM5 simulates the movement of atmospheric gases globally, using winds and atmospheric mixing as derived from the global weather forecast. The model has been used for the main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), chemically active species such as ozone (O3), and various aerosols.\n\nThis SOS animation shows total column abundance of CO across the globe, consistent with measurements made at a large number of sites within the NOAA greenhouse gas reference network. The total column abundance, which is the total amount of CO between the surface and the top of the atmosphere, is also expressed in ppb, so that 100 ppb CO would signify the presence of 100 molecules of CO per billion molecules of air.\n\nFossil fuel burning and fires contribute about 40% of the roughly 2700 Teragrams of CO emitted each year; the remaining 60% come from the oxidation of CH4 and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The global average concentration of CO, unlike that of CO2, is fairly constant from year to year, so all the CO produced must be somehow destroyed. About 90% of the destruction is due to oxidation by OH, whereas the other 10% is absorbed by the soil.\n\nIn this dataset, one of the most obvious features is the difference in CO concentration between the northern and the southern hemisphere. The northern hemisphere has more sources of CO because most of the fossil fuel emissions are in that hemisphere. The average lifetime of CO is about 2 months, which is much shorter than the time required for concentrations in the two hemispheres to equilibrate. Therefore, the CO produced in the north is destroyed before it can cross the equator and raise concentrations there. As a result, the north is perpetually higher in CO than the south.\n\nThe other striking feature is the consistent presence of big patches of CO over Equatorial Africa, India and China. This is due primarily to biomass burning over Africa and industrial activity (coal power plants, cars with inefficient combustion) over India and China. The emissions over India get trapped by the Himalayas, leading to the contrast between India and Tibet in the CO fields.\n\nThere are also seasonal variations visible in the dataset. For example, the CO concentration in the northern hemisphere goes down significantly in June, July and August. This is because higher temperatures in the north mean that the air carries more moisture, which produces more OH, which destroys CO faster in the summer. Conversely, the opposite effect is seen in the southern hemisphere, where winter (June - Aug) concentrations of CO are higher than summer (Dec - Feb) concentrations of CO.\n\nGlobally, the production of CO from biomass burning has two main seasons. March to May is dry season in northern tropical and temperate Asia, so in those seasons big red patches of CO can be seen over China, India and SE Asia. August to October is the dry season in the southern extra-tropics, so you see large red patches of biomass burning over southern Amazonia and sub-Saharan Africa. And lastly, December and January are biomass burning seasons in equatorial Africa. Of course, the exact timing and magnitude of these different fires vary from year to year. For example, in Amazonia 2010 was an unusually large biomass burning year, a fact evident from comparing August and September 2010 with the same months in other years.\n\nFinally, you will sometimes see patches of blue (i.e., reduction from background values) right next to bright red patches (e.g., March 2008 over NE China and March 2010 over SE China). These are not real atmospheric signals, but rather artifacts of our limited measurement coverage. If we had more atmospheric measurements of CO over those \"blue patches\", they would go away because we would be able to better estimate the true atmospheric state of CO.",

    "description": "\"NOAA encourages science that adds benefit to society and the environment. CarbonTracker does both.\" said retired Navy Vice Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher, Ph.D., former undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator. CarbonTracker is a system to keep track of carbon dioxide uptake and release at the Earth's surface over time. It was developed by the Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory. As a scientific tool, CarbonTracker has helped improve the understanding of carbon uptake and release from the land and oceans, and how those sources and sinks are responding to the changing climate, increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 (the CO2 fertilization effect), and human management of land and oceans. CarbonTracker relies on the long-term monitoring of atmospheric CO2 performed by the NOAA Global Monitoring Division and international partners.\n\nThis data set shows the distribution of carbon dioxide in the \"free troposphere\", which is the lower atmosphere below the tropopause, but above the surface-dominated planetary boundary layer. CO2 distributions are displayed for every day from 2000 through 2018. The large variations in CO2 seen here are caused by surface sources and sinks of CO2, coupled with transport of CO2 plumes by weather systems. The resulting patterns seen here are called \"carbon weather\".\n\nWhite dots represent the times and locations of CO2 measurements from surface stations, ships, and aircraft from the more than 70 laboratories in 21 countries participating in the GLOBALVIEW+ program. These are the locations for which we know the mixing ratios of CO2 exactly. The rest of the globe is filled in by a computer model driven by our best knowledge of the surface sources and sinks (fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions, land biosphere and ocean uptake or release) of CO2 that are across the globe. On the colorbar, a white line moves to depict the global average atmospheric CO2 concentration as it changes over time.\n\nPlumes of CO2 can be seen moving across the globe, illustrating the importance of monitoring CO2 globally, not just locally. The large variations in CO2 concentration from season to season are due to the annual cycle of summertime green-up and autumn decay of land plants. During the winter season, plants and trees respire CO2 as they shed leaves and stop growing or decay, adding significant amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere. This process reverses during spring and summer, when plants have access to sufficient sunlight and grow leaves and flowers, or increase their size substantially and remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The summer green-up is quite visible in the movie: in July the northern hemisphere shows intense blue colors, especially over the mid-latitude regions where forests and crops take up CO2 vigorously. The large change in CO2 between the seasons caused by plant activity is sometimes referred to as the 'breathing' of the planet. In the tropics, intense red areas are visible especially during July, August and September. This is due to the burning of biomass. Some of this is natural, such as dry grasses on the savannas burning, but most of it is man-made as people burn fields to prepare them for another year of production, or burn forests to make way for new agricultural lands.\n\nThis dataset is named \"fixed scale,\" because the colorbar does not change over time, it is fixed, which is best used to show the overall growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration over time. A similar dataset, CarbonTracker: Sliding Scale, shows change of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration between 2000 - 2018 by adding a sliding scale legend, which is best used for visualizing CO2 being moved around the Earth by weather patterns.\n\nBoth datasets have small white dots, which symbolize the observation sites where glass flask atmospheric samples are taken worldwide. The observation dots are a layer that can be toggled on or off using the layers tab.\n\nFind out more about NOAA CarbonTracker.",

As the global average increases in the visualization through December 2018, the color light blue changes value to depict 400 ppm, the global average at the end of 2014. The sliding scale dataset is best used to show the CO2 being moved around the Earth by weather patterns.

    "description": "Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and is also the only dwarf planet in this part of the solar system.\n\nIt is composed of rock and ice, is 950 kilometers (590 miles) in diameter, and comprises approximately one third of the mass of the asteroid belt.\n\nThe surface of Ceres is covered with craters of many shapes and sizes, as seen in this mosaic of the dwarf planet comprised of images taken by NASA's Dawn mission in 2015 from a distance of nearly 4400km (2700 miles) to 13600km (8500 miles). A more complete set of images are now being taken at close range that will allow improved maps to be made for Ceres. An unusually large basin nearly 186 miles (300 kilometers) across is seen just south of the equator, with a shallow interior, faint rim and low-relief mounds within. Several bright spots are seen, including two that are very bright and lie within a single crater north of the equator.\n\nThe bright spots in the center of that crater are starting to be resolved. They are overexposed in this map, so we only have an approximate view of their brightness.",

It is about 750 miles in diameter, having more than half the diameter of Pluto causing the center of gravity of the two bodies to lie outside of Pluto. Charon and Pluto revolve around their center of mass every 6.4 days.\n\nThe New Horizons spacecraft provided the first highly detailed look at Charon during its flyby in 2015 and this map is constructed from images returned from the spacecraft. Charon's density is about 1.6 times that of water, suggesting a nearly even composition of rock and ice.\n\nCharon has a bright coating of water ice (including ice crystals mixed with ammonia hydrates) near the equator and darker areas near the poles. This with the occurrence of relatively few craters suggests Charon has been and may still be geologically active.\n\nDue to the rotation of Charon and the position of the spacecraft, the image of Charon is not complete and is partially high resolution. This image has enhanced color.",

    "description": "Climate models are used for a variety of purposes from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory has created several ocean-atmosphere coupled models to predict how greenhouse gas emissions following different population, economic, and energy-use projections may affect the planet.\n\nIn SOSx, it's possible to compare two datasets at once using the two-globe view. Comparing the Climate Model: Temperature Change (RCP 2.6) - 2006-2100 to Climate Model: Temperature Change (RCP 8.5) - 2006-2100 shows essentially the best and worst case scenario for expected temperature change as a result of global warming.\n\nThe RCP 2.6 scenario is a so-called \"peak\" scenario, which means the radiative forcing level reaches 3.1 W/m2 by mid-century but returns to 2.6 W/m2 by 2100. In the RCP 8.5 emissions scenario the radiative forcing level reaches 8.5 W/m2 characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time representative for scenarios in the literature leading to high greenhouse gas concentration levels.\n\nFor more information on data used click here.",

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, we show the projected change in precipitation under the SSP1 scenario, using GFDL's ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP1-1.9 is a very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario where carbon dioxide emissions cut to net zero around 2050. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nIn this imagery, if an area is colored orange, it is projected to be less precipitation than the 20th century average; if it is green, then it is projected to be higher precipitation than the 20th century average.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: Only SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.",

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, we show the projected change in precipitation under the SSP2 scenario, using GFDL's ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP2-4.5 is an intermediate greenhouse gas emissions scenario where carbon dioxide emissions continue around current levels until 2050, then decrease but do not reach net zero by 2100. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nIn this imagery, if an area is colored orange, it is projected to be less precipitation than the 20th century average; if it is green, then it is projected to be higher precipitation than the 20th century average.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: Only SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.",

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, sea ice, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, we show the projected percentage of sea ice concentration according to the SSP2, using GFDL's ESM4 between 2015 and 2100. SSP2-4.5 is an intermediate greenhouse gas emissions scenario where carbon dioxide emissions continue around current levels until 2050, then decrease but do not reach net zero by 2100. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nIn this imagery, the whiter the area, the higher the percentage of projected sea ice.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: Only SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.",

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, sea ice, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, we show the projected change in temperature of the ocean under the SSP1 emissions scenario, using GFDL's ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP1-1.9 is a very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario where carbon dioxide emissions cut to net zero around 2050. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nIn this imagery, if ocean is colored red, it is projected to be warmer than the 20th century average; if it is blue, then it is projected to be cooler than the 20th century average.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: Only SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.",

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, we show the projected change in surface air temperatures under the SSP1 scenario, using the GFDL-ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP1-1.9 is a very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario where carbon dioxide emissions cut to net zero around 2050. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nIn this imagery, if temperature is colored red, it is projected to be higher than the 20th century average; if it is blue, then it is projected to be lower than the 20th century average.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: Only SSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.\n\nPaper Globe Cutouts are available for this dataset!",

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, we show the projected change in surface air temperatures under the SSP5 scenario, using GFDL-ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP5-8.5 is a very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario - and unlikely to happen - where carbon dioxide emissions triple by 2075. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nIn this imagery, if temperature is colored red, it is projected to be higher than the 20th century average; if it is blue, then it is projected to be lower than the 20th century average.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: OnlySSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.\n\nPaper Globe Cutouts are available for this dataset!",

Satellite measurements provide consistent, near-real time, global maps of pollution gas hot spots around the world.\n\nWhen Earth is viewed from space at night, brightest areas show the biggest cities and industrial areas. These areas correspond to increased air pollution. An example of a common air pollutant, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) gas is released into the air primarily by burning fossil fuels. It is unhealthy to breathe and reacts with other gases and sunlight to produce ground-level ozone, which is also unhealthy to breathe. NO2 imagery shows the greatest emissions around the world from industry, vehicle exhaust and fires due to deforestation and agricultural burning. One can see evidence of some combination of these over all continents, except Antarctica, with densely populated areas showing more pollution.\n\nThe length of this dataset is 1:58.",

The time series has natural increases and decreases due to the seasonal cycle with a long-term trend toward rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. The natural seasonal cycle is explained using satellite imagery of vegetation on land and in the ocean: when more terrestrial plants are growing during Northern Hemisphere spring and summer, they use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis and atmospheric CO2 levels decrease. During winter when Northern Hemisphere terrestrial plants are dormant, they stop using CO2 and release some of it back to the atmosphere causing increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Satellite imagery of atmospheric CO2 since 2002 shows the long-term increase. The Mauna Loa CO2 record first reached 400ppm in May, 2013 and has been increasingly above 400ppm since then.\n\nLength of dataset: 2:46",

    "description": "This video gives an overview of the causes and consequences of El Nino. This aperiodic fluctuation in atmosphere and ocean circulation in the equatorial Pacific impacts weather around the world. The phenomenon is associated with a cessation of the normal east-to-west trade winds in the east Pacific and the subsequent eastward propagation of the west Pacific warm pool across the basin. Because the marine food web depends upon phytoplankton blooms fertilized by nutrients upwelled from depth, their reduction during an El Nino event causes starvation up the marine food web in the east equatorial Pacific. Additionally, weather in other places has been linked to El Nino: with a greater chance of rain from California to Florida but drought in southeast Asia during an El Nino winter. Although our ability to detect the onset of an El Nino event has greatly improved over the past 20 years with increased monitoring by satellites and ocean buoys, scientists cannot predict it more than a few months in advance.\n\nLength of dataset: 1:59",

Young, fast carbon such as a banana comes from plants growing now. When we eat a banana and breathe out carbon dioxide, we do not add to the long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide level. Old, slow carbon such as coal has been locked away for millions of years. When we dig it up and burn it, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases over the long-term (i.e. decade and longer). One of the byproducts of burning carbon is black carbon or soot, shown over the Earth at night to highlight the correspondence between black carbon and city lights.

    "description": "Phytoplankton are microscopic organisms that form the base of the marine food web and are responsible for about half of the oxygen on Earth. Although microscopic, their abundance can be measured by Earth observing satellites because their green pigment, chlorophyll, changes the color of the water. From measurements collected at sea and analyzed for their biological and optical properties, we know there are many thousands of kinds of phytoplankton. Computer models that include ocean biology and physics help us estimate where different phytoplankton types dominate, which affect fisheries and how much atmospheric carbon the ocean can absorb. Future satellites are being designed to monitor global phytoplankton diversity to tell us more about these organisms and how they impact our ocean\u2019s health and our climate.

    "description": "This video gives a brief overview of solar radiation received on Earth. The transfer of energy from the sun to Earth across nearly empty space happens primarily by radiation. Radiation occurs without the involvement of a physical substance as the medium. The sun emits many forms of electromagnetic radiation in varying quantities.\n\nA perfect radiating body emits energy in all possible wavelengths, but the wave energies are not emitted equally in all wavelengths; a spectrum shows a maximum in energy at a particular wavelength depending upon the temperature of the radiating body. As the temperature increases, the maximum radiation occurs at shorter and shorter wavelengths. The hotter the radiating body, the shorter the wavelength of maximum radiation. For example, a very hot metal rod will emit visible radiation and produce a white glow. On cooling, it will emit more of its energy in longer wavelengths and will glow a reddish color. Eventually no light will be given off, but if you place your hand near the rod, the infrared radiation will be detectable as heat.\n\nLength of dataset 1:38",

The UV Index is forecast daily by the National Weather Service and posted by local weather channels.\n\nLength of dataset: 1:54",

    "description": "In this new layered version of two existing SOS datasets, we've combined Clouds - Real-time with Precipitation - Real-time to give a uniquely meaningful glimpse of global weather over the last month. Where you see bright colors over the clouds, there has been precipitation measured by satellites. Warm colors are rain and cold colors are snow.\n\nGeostationary infrared satellite images are used by meteorologists to determine where clouds are, but more importantly, how the clouds are moving. The infrared, IR, satellites work by measuring the infrared radiation that is emitted. Because the emitted radiation is proportional to temperature, the data are converted to temperature values, which can be useful for meteorologists. In comparison to clouds, the Earth's surface, even on very cold nights, is warm. When there are clouds, they absorb the radiation emitted by the Earth below and emit their own radiation at a much cooler temperature. Any area that has clouds shows up cooler than the ground, allowing meteorologists to detect the locations of the clouds. The height of clouds is inversely proportional to temperature, meaning that the tallest clouds are the coldest. It is often the tallest clouds that bring the most severe weather.\n\nThe satellites that collect these data are geostationary, meaning that they rotate at the same rate as the Earth so that the satellites are over the same spot on Earth all the time. This allows them to collect a continuous stream of data for one location so that \"movies\" of the data can be made. Over the United States there are two such satellites, the GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) - East and GOES-West. There are many such satellites worldwide. This dataset is a composite of GOES, Meteosat, and MTSat satellite data. Meteosat and MTSat are similar to GOES, but are operated by other countries. This real-time dataset is shaded on a gray scale, meaning that the lowest clouds are a very light gray and the highest clouds are bright white. The \"Blue Marble\" is the background image for this dataset. Data for this visualization is available for the past thirty days.\n\nPrecipitation (falling rain and snow) that occurs around the globe is the source of fresh water on which all life depends. Even in the tropics, much of the precipitation begins as snow in the clouds high above the surface, then generally melts as it falls into warmer temperatures near the surface, except when the surface temperature is below freezing. The heaviest precipitation is found in the persistent band near the Equator, known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Just outside the ITCZ, more noticeably in the Northern Hemisphere, the tight swirls of tropical storms (including hurricanes and typhoons) can be seen occasionally in the northern summer. At subtropical latitudes in both hemispheres there are persistent dry areas associated with subtropical high pressure centers. The major deserts of the world occur in the subtropical highs, but these highs also cover vast regions of the oceans. At midlatitudes, the storm tracks display the swirls of low pressure systems and bands of frontal precipitation. [Note the opposite directions of circulation in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres!] Important year-to-year and shorter-interval variations cause strong modifications to local conditions, bringing droughts and floods.\n\nPrecipitation changes the naturally occurring microwave energy emitted by the Earth's surface and atmosphere. These signals are detected by satellite instruments that are attuned to specific microwave frequencies. In addition, a few satellites carry weather radars, providing data to adjust the estimates of precipitation from the microwave instruments. Finally, sometimes it is useful to estimate precipitation from information about cloudiness that is provided by infrared sensors flying on geostationary satellites (geo-IR).\n\nThis NASA GPM IMERG dataset is provided to Science On a Sphere in near-real time, about six hours after the observation. This dataset uses information from as many satellite microwave sensors as possible, and includes satellite radar data for calibration and geo-IR for additional information. The satellite data provide observations at each location about every three hours or less, and smooth transitions from one observation to the next are computed to give estimates every half hour.",

    "description": "During her confirmation hearings to become administrator of NOAA, Dr. Jane Lubchenco explained her perspective on decision-making that affects broad swaths of society. She stated that science is essential for making good decisions but that political processes also weigh human values. Meaningful climate policies aimed at adaptation and mitigation will certainly require Earth systems science, stewardship, and management from NOAA, NASA, and other U.S. science agencies. This welcome message, created for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 15th Conference of Parties (COP15) held December 7-18, 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark, sets those capabilities in a larger context in the spirit of Dr. Lubchenco's statements by also emphasizing that individuals and nations have solutions and choices available today.\n\nThe impetus for COP15 is that many nations face many challenges due to climate change. Each nation also has many possible solutions at hand. Regardless of what path nations take individually or together, we all share one integrated climate system. US Earth science agencies, like their counterparts internationally, monitor and model the Earth system continuously. Over a century of ground observations, decades of satellite monitoring, and computer modeling show us both the variability of climate patterns and long-term climate change trends. This media piece deliberately emphasizes that our understanding of climate change is built on sets of observations from land, in the ocean, in the cryosphere (snow and ice), and in the atmosphere. Taken together, the weight of evidence tells us all that anthropogenic climate change is real. The piece closes with a nod toward the common interest scientists, politicians, business leaders, and world citizens share to find solutions to human-caused climate change. We have many solutions available to us, but mustering the will to enact those solutions requires a common sense of purpose. With that motivation in mind, the piece illustrate humanity's cultural diversity and that we have a common purpose and interest in sustaining the physical and biological systems that sustain commerce, political stability, ecosystems, and species all over the planet. More simply, we only know of one planet in the universe that will sustain life, so our common purpose is to maintain that life support system.\n\nThe piece opens with \"Welcome\" translated into 23 languages so that people from diverse geographies will feel drawn in to the presentation. All annotations are rendered in the official languages of the United Nations: Arabic, simplified Chinese, Danish, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. This piece is available to the Science on a Sphere network in hopes it can support the communications objectives of each member institution.\n\nLength of dataset: 3:28",

    "description": "This dataset shows global satellite product displaying the highest thermal stress level on coral reefs during the past seven days; updated daily.\n\nThe NOAA Coral Reef Watch daily 5-km satellite Bleaching Alert Area (7-day maximum) product identifies areas where coral bleaching thermal stress currently reaches various pre-defined levels, based on NOAA's satellite sea surface temperature (SST) monitoring. Each pre-defined level (described in the table below) is based on the intensity of the bleaching thermal stress measured by Coral Reef Watch's 5-km Coral Bleaching HotSpot and Degree Heating Week (DHW) products. The 5-km Bleaching Alert Area is a 7-day maximum composite (rather than being a single-day product, as with NOAA Coral Reef Watch's other 5-km satellite products) to account for day-to-day fluctuations in the level of thermal stress monitored in highly-variable coral reef locations.\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) variability is often high at the 5-km spatial and daily temporal resolutions that may result extensive day-to-day fluctuations between stress levels in highly-variable locations in a single-day-based Bleaching Alert Area product. To consistently and adequately identify potentially harmful thermal stress levels, especially with regard to the impact of accumulated thermal stress for each data grid, the maximum of the single-day Bleaching Alert Areas over the latest consecutive seven days is presented here. The 7-day moving window advances for each daily product update. The data and images are updated daily and dated on the last day of the 7-day period.",

    "description": "This real-time dataset is a global satellite product showing accumulated thermal stress to coral reefs that can lead to bleaching; updated daily.\n\nThe NOAA Coral Reef Watch daily 5-km satellite Degree Heating Week (DHW) product monitors accumulated thermal stress that can lead to coral bleaching and subsequent death. The product's color scale ranges from 0 to 20\u2103-weeks. It is directly related to the timing and intensity of coral bleaching.\n\nThe DHW accumulates daily Coral Bleaching HotSpot values, for the previous 12-weeks, that meet or exceed 1\u2103 above the maximum monthly mean (MMM) temperataure (or the warmest of the twelve monthly mean temperatures in the climatology) for all known coral reef locations worldwide. As an example, for a coral reef area where the HotSpot was either 1\u2103 above the MMM for two weeks OR 2 \u2103 above the MMM for one week during the preceding 12-week period, its DHW value would be the same, 2\u2103-weeks.\n\nSignificant coral bleaching usually occurs when the DHW value reaches 4\u2103-weeks. By the time the DHW reaches 8\u2103-weeks, widespread bleaching is likely and significant mortality can be expected.\n\nThe NOAA Coral Reef Watch program's satellite data provide current reef environmental conditions to quickly identify areas at risk for coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals lose the symbiotic algae that give them their distinctive colors. If a coral is severely bleached, disease, partial mortality and/or death become likely.\n\nContinuous monitoring of sea surface temperature (SST) at global scales provides resource managers, researchers and other stakeholders with tools to understand and better manage the complex interactions on a reef that lead to coral bleaching. When bleaching conditions occur, NOAA Coral Reef Watch's satellite (and modeled) tools are used to trigger bleaching response plans and support appropriate management decisions.\n\nVisit NOAA Coral Reef Watch for data source information.",

    "description": "From tourism to disease prevention, it\u2019s clear that reefs offer much more than recreation. According to the newly released Reefs at Risk Revisited report, coral reefs:\n\nYet coral reefs today face serious threats. The new report finds that approximately 75% of world\u2019s coral reefs are currently threatened by local and global pressures. Local pressures pose the most immediate threat - especially from overfishing and destructive fishing, which is particularly widespread in Southeast Asia. Global threats from climate change and alterations in ocean chemistry (i.e. ocean acidification) are compounding the pressures on reefs. Climate change is causing ocean temperatures to rise, which, in turn, is leading to wide-spread coral bleaching.\n\nThis dataset for SOS looks at the present state of coral reefs and then into the future. The present image shows the threat category for coral reefs due to local activities such as overfishing and destructive fishing, marine-based pollution, coastal development, and watershed-based pollution. The projected images in 2030 and 2050 show local threats combined with projections of thermal stress and ocean acidification using a \"business as usual\" greenhouse gas emissions scenario. According to the report, left unchecked, combined local and global pressures will push 90 percent of coral reefs to threatened status (all non-blue colors) in less than 20 years (by 2030) and nearly all reefs will be threatened by 2050.\n\nImage Details\nReefs are assigned their threat category from the integrated local threat index as a starting point. Threat is raised one level if reefs are at high threat from either thermal stress or ocean acidification, or if they are at medium threat for both. If reefs are at high threat for both thermal stress and acidification, the threat classification is increased by two levels. The analysis assumes no increase in future local pressure on reefs, and no reduction in local threats due to improvements in management.",

    "description": "\" Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, WMAP, is a NASA Explorer mission measuring the temperature of the cosmic background radiation over the full sky with unprecedented accuracy. This map of remnant heat from the Big Bang provides answers to fundamental questions about the origin and fate of our universe. \" \u2014 From the NASA/WAMP website The probe is over 930,000 miles from Earth and effectively scans the entire sky every six months.\n\nTemperature fluctuations displayed here are 13.7 billion years old, from the time when the Big Bang was thought to have occurred. Essentially, it is a detailed, all-sky display of the young universe developed from three years of WMAP data. The blue areas are cooler while the red areas are warmer. The temperature range on this map is \u00b1 200 microKelvin, which is incredibly small. The temperature range is so small because it doesn\u2019t measure absolute temperature but anisotropy. Anisotropy is the difference between two measurements taken in opposite directions. This is much more accurate than simply measuring the absolute temperature in one direction. This data is used to support the Big Bang theory using inflation. The concept is that the universe expanded many trillion times its size in less than a trillionth of a second at the beginning of the Big Bang. This is a map of the remnant heat left from the big bang. According to NASA, the measurements reveal size, matter content, age, geometry, and the fate of the universe.\n\nThere are two versions of the WMAP data. This dataset is from the third year of data collected and is polarized and has a higher resolution. In the third year dataset, the formation site of the Milky Way galaxy is visible in the red band. The other available dataset from the first year of data collected by WMAP and is lower resolution.\n\nSource: http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html .",

    "description": "How can a community CREATE a vision of resilience? Resilient communities are knowledgeable about their local environment, the hazards and risks, and their assets and strengths. Community members are engaged and connected with each other, able to prepare for and adapt to a changing climate. To help local communities develop a shared vision of community resilience, the Nurture Nature Center (NNC), a non-profit located in Easton, PA that strives to build community resiliency by leveraging the power of informal science education, art-centered approaches to learning, and community dialogue and networking, embarked on a four year project funded by NOAA\u2019s Environmental Literacy Program. During the CREATE Resilience project, NNC worked with youth, adults, and municipal leaders in three communities \u2013 Easton, Wilson, and Bangor, PA \u2013 to increase knowledge of weather and climate science, the risks from local hazards, and strategies for hazard mitigation. Through community meetings, surveys, interviews, story-telling and photovoice exhibits, forums, tours, and community mapping exercises, NNC engaged the community in thinking about what resilience means in order to co-create a vision of community resilience, depicted in large murals created by participating, local artists active in each community.\n\nThis roughly four minute film was created specifically for the Science on a Sphere and provides an overview of the CREATE Resilience project. It features interviews with a local official, artist, emergency management professional, community member, and youth ambassador, and showcases the three community murals that reflect each community\u2019s vision of resilience. The film is meant to share the project (a unique combination of science, art, and community) and provide inspiration and an example to other communities interested in a resiliency focus.\n\nYou can check out more details about the project at NNC\u2019s website, take a virtual resiliency tour, and access community guidebooks along with other resilience related resources.\n\nNote: This film may be shared and distributed only among the NOAA Science On a Sphere network for members to display at their site. This film may not be displayed on any application other than a Science On a Sphere. No segment of the film may be repurposed or distributed in any way other than its original intended use. The film must be shown in its entirety.",

    "description": "In SOSx, it's possible to compare two datasets at once using the two-globe view. These visualizations, created by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Institute on the Environment, show the global land use intensity for pastureland and cropland. Cropland is land devoted to growing plants for humans use for food, material, or fuel. Pastureland is land used for raising and grazing animals. Altogether, cropland covers about 16 million square kilometers, an area of land approximately the size of South America. Global pastureland occupies more than 30 million square kilometers, about the area of Africa.\n\nCumulatively, agricultural land covers about 40% of the Earth\u2019s land surface, and the vast majority of its arable land. Creating additional farmlands would require the destruction of other ecosystems, such as the tropical rainforests. Talking points could revolve around the value of food production versus the value of the ecosystem services provided by rainforests, intensification of agriculture compared to agricultural expansion, and what the long term repercussions of each strategy might be.",

    "description": "Humans have manipulated rivers for thousands of years, but over the last 200 years dams on rivers have become rampant. Reservoirs and dams are constructed for water storage, to reduce the risk of river flooding, and for the generation of power. They are one of the major footprints of humans on Earth and change the world's hydrological cycle.\n\nThis dataset illustrates the construction of dams worldwide from 1800 to the present. We display all dams listed in the Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD). It includes 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams. All dams that have a reservoir with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers are included, and many smaller dams were added where data were available. The total amount of water stored behind these dams sums to 6.2 km3. The red dots indicate the newly built dams and reservoirs each year, and the yellow dots represent the dams already in place. The dams and reservoirs do not only store water, they also trap the incoming sediment that the river transports. Consequently, much less sand and clay travels to the coast, where it would normally be depositing in the delta region. The reduced sediment load of major rivers has influenced the vulnerability of many deltas worldwide.\n\nEducational materials have been developed for this dataset, including a few PowerPoint slides, that can be used on a supplementary screen while viewing the dataset on Science On a Sphere\u00ae. Also, a discussion-based lesson plan can be used to facilitate student learning about the economics and ecology of dams.\n\nThis dataset was made possible by Community Surfaces Dynamic Modeling Systems (CSDMS). The worldwide dams dataset can be viewed here as well as the United States dams only here.\n\nLehner, B., C. Reidy Liermann, C. Revenga, C. V\u00f6r\u00f6smart, B. Fekete, P. Crouzet, P.

We display all dams listed in the Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD).

Consequently, much less sand and clay travels to the coast, where it would normally be depositing in the delta region. The reduced sediment load of major rivers has influenced the vulnerability of many deltas worldwide.\n\nThis movie zooms in on dam development in the Mississippi River basin in the USA. The Mississippi River drains about 40% of the continental US, and about 50 cities currently rely directly on the Mississippi river for drinking water. Between 1880 and 1912 a series of dams were built upstream, the so-called 'Headwater Dams', for flood prevention and to assure shipping. Dam construction continued and peaked in the 1950's, and nowadays there are 1,000's of dams spread throughout the Mississippi basin. Consequently, the most downstream areas of the Mississippi delta and Louisiana coastal zone receive much less sediment than under natural conditions, causing the delta area to shrink.\n\nEducational materials have been developed for the related global dams dataset, including a few PowerPoint slides, that can be used on a supplementary screen while viewing the dataset on Science On a Sphere\u00ae.

    "description": "Humans have manipulated rivers for thousands of years, but over the last 200 years dams on rivers have become rampant. Reservoirs and dams are constructed for water storage, to reduce the risk of river flooding, and for the generation of power. They are one of the major footprints of humans on Earth and change the world's hydrological cycle.\n\nThis dataset illustrates the construction of dams in China's Yangtze River Basin from 1800-2010. We display all dams listed in the Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD). All dams that have a reservoir with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers are included, and many smaller dams were added where data were available.\n\nThe red dots indicate the newly built dams and reservoirs each year, and the yellow dots represent the dams already in place. Grey dots indicate dams being built along other rivers worldwide.\n\nThe dams and reservoirs do not only store water, they also trap the incoming sediment that the river transports. Consequently, much less sand and clay travels to the coast, where it would normally be depositing in the delta region. The reduced sediment load of major rivers has influenced the vulnerability of many deltas worldwide.\n\nThe Yangtze River Basin has experienced significant development from the 1950s-present. It currently has 50,000 reservoirs of various sizes. The biggest dam in this basin is the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, which was completed in 2003 and is one of the world's largest hydroelectricity plants. The Yangtze River is largest river in China, and nearly 500 million people reside in its watershed. Approximately 20 more dams are scheduled to be constructed in Yangtze River Basin by 2015.\n\nEducational materials have been developed for the global dams dataset, including a few PowerPoint slides, that can be used on a supplementary screen while viewing the dataset on Science On a Sphere\u00ae. Also, a discussion-based lesson plan can be used to facilitate student learning about the economics and ecology of dams.\n\nThis dataset was made possible by Community Surfaces Dynamic Modeling Systems (CSDMS). The worldwide dams dataset can be viewed here as well as the United States dams only here.\n\nReferences: Fuggle, R., and Smith, W., 2000.

    "description": "The line that separates day and night is called the terminator. It is also referred to as the \"grey line\" and the \"twilight zone.\" It is a fuzzy line due to our atmosphere bending sunlight. In fact, the atmosphere bends sunlight by half a degree, which is about 37 miles (60 km). It is commonly thought that while half of the Earth is covered in darkness, the other half is covered in sunlight. This is actually not true because of the bending of the sunlight results in the land covered by sunlight having greater area than the land covered by darkness.\n\nThe shape of the terminator curve changes with the seasons. This difference is especially noticeable when the terminator curve from an equinox is compared to the terminator curve from a solstice. There are three different datasets that show the terminator during 2007. In 2007, the spring equinox was March 21, the fall equinox was September 23, the summer solstice was June 21, and the winter solstice was December 22. During the equinox, the sun can be observed directly over the equator. This means that day and night are approximately the same length. The equinox is also thought of as the start of spring and fall. Because at equinox there is no tilt of the Earth with respect to the sun, the terminator line is parallel to the axis of the Earth and to lines of longitude. The solstice occurs when the Earth's axis tilts most toward or away from the sun, causing the sun to be further north or south of the equator than any other time. The shortest day of the year is winter solstice and the longest day is summer solstice. When the Earth is tilted away from the sun, the sun appears south of the equator and when the Earth is titled toward the sun, the sun appears north of the equator. During solstice, the terminator line is at its greatest angle with respect to the axis of the Earth, which is approximately 23.5 degrees.\n\nThis dataset shows the terminator through the entire year with has one image for each day, so that the changes in the terminator angle are easy to see.",

    "description": "This dataset shows all known locations of deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Hydrothermal vents form in places where there is volcanic activity, such as along Earth\u2019s plate boundaries. They occur when seawater seeps down and is heated deep beneath the seafloor. The hot fluid rises and gushes out of vents at temperatures up to 400 deg C (more than 750 deg F!), carrying with it chemical energy that supports life in the otherwise cold, dark, deep sea.\n\nThis subset of the InterRidge Vents Database maps the locations of the total known (241) deep-sea vent fields that were confirmed active by observations at the seafloor at depths greater than 200 m, as of year 2016. Note: a vent field is a cluster of vent sites in relatively close proximity (i.e., on the order of 0.1-1 km).\n\nThis dataset shows deep-sea vent locations as star icons, along with volcano locations as triangles icons, over the ETOPO1 base image. The dataset includes additional image files: icons (which can be used as a pointer or stamped on the image) including deep-diving vehicles Alvin and Jason, and a PIP (picture in picture) showing a cross section diagram through a hydrothermal vent. All of these are layers that can be toggled on & off. More information on the PIP: Cold seawater (blue) seeps into the seafloor, circulates near a heat source (red) deep beneath the seafloor, becomes hot and buoyant, and flows upward (red to yellow to white) into focused hydrothermal vents (black smokers) and diffuse hydrothermal vents. We recommend also using the overlay Plate Boundaries - Colorized.\n\nIn addition, you may be interested in the Deep-Sea Vent Discoveries dataset, showing the discoveries of these vents over time.",

    "description": "The two moons of Mars hold several distinctions in the solar system. Phobos, the innermost moon of Mars, is the closest moon to any planet in the solar system. Phobos is less than 3700 miles (6000 km) from the surface of Mars. In contrast, the Earth's moon is 240,000 miles (384,400 km) from the Earth. Deimos, the outermost and smaller moon of Mars, is one of the smallest known moons in the solar system. Both of moon's names are derived from the Greek language. Phobos is Greek for fear and Deimos is Greek for panic\n\nMany scientists believe that Phobos and Deimos are captured asteroids from the outer solar system, but there are other scientists who counter this idea. Both moons have a low density, which means that they cannot be made of pure rock, but rather a mixture of rock and ice. Another similarity between the two moons is that they are both heavily cratered. Deimos does have a slightly smoother appearance, due to the filling of some of its craters. One of the main features on Phobos is a large impact crater. The impact was so severe that scientists think the impact probably came close to shattering the moon. Striated patterns from the impact can be traced over a large portion of the landscape of Phobos.",

    "description": "Dengue fever is an infectious tropical disease that is caused by the dengue virus and transmitted by mosquitoes. Symptoms of dengue fever, also called breakbone fever, are headache, muscle ache, fever, and a measle-like rash. Incidence of dengue fever has dramatically increased since the 1960's, infecting hundreds of millions of people yearly, making it \"the most important mosquito-borne viral pathogen affecting humans today,\" according to IDAMS.\n\nThis map was developed by IDAMS: the International Research Consortium on Dengue Risk Assessment, Management, and Surveillance. This group is a conglomerate of international experts that work together to improve the diagnosis and management of dengue fever. In order to accomplish this, IDAMS focuses on the creation of new and innovative tools to control dengue fever on a global scale.\n\nThis map displays the global probability of occurrence for dengue fever in 2010. Ranging from 0 in white to 100% in dark red. For example, a 20% probability of occurrence means that the likelihood that someone in the 5 sq km region will contract dengue within the year is 20%. We can see that there are many places throughout the world with high probability of dengue fever. Using models, IDAMS estimates that there are 390 million cases of dengue each year which is 3 times that previously estimated. Of the 390 million cases, only 100 million are symptomatic while the remaining are estimated inapparent. The inapparent cases, or the cases that have no symptoms, are a large piece to the transmission of the disease and an important part of the story behind the global distribution of dengue fever.\n\nFor more information, please visit IDAMS website.",

    "description": "Dione is one of the densest of Saturn\u2019s 47 moons. While most of Saturn\u2019s moons have a mostly icy composition, Dione likely has a rocky core which accounts for one third of the moon\u2019s mass, with the rest being ice. The surface of Dione is cratered, but varying in intensity, with heavily cratered plains, moderated cratered plains, lightly cratered plains and streaks that appear lighter. The leading hemisphere and the trailing hemisphere are different, with most of the heavily cratered plains on the leading hemisphere, and the lightly cratered plains along with the wispy material on the trailing hemisphere.\n\nUntil the Cassini probe flew by in December of 2004, the origin of the bright streaks on Dione was unknown. The original hypothesis was proved wrong when the latest images from Cassini were made available. It appears from the latest photographs that the bright streaks are ice cliffs created by tectonic fractures. Due to Cassini\u2019s closer fly by in October of 2005, it is now known that some of the cliffs are almost 1000 feet high.",

By measuring these differences and observing the patterns of vegetation --or its lack of growth--NOAA scientists can monitor how droughts are changing across the world through time.\n\nThis global drought risk composite is derived from datasets developed by NOAA from measurements on the Visible-Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite, or VIIRS, onboard the NPP satellite. By monitoring vegetation health, moisture and thermal conditions, scientists are able to identify areas that are considered to be vegetatively stressed due to drought. An important note is that the drought imagery is based solely on the analysis of vegetation health and stress, not soil moisture conditions. But this index serves as a reliable proxy measurement for drought worldwide. Areas of desert and snow cover are not included in the analysis. Yellow areas indicate areas under moderate drought conditions; red indicates areas experiencing extreme drought conditions. Other VIIRS datasets include Nighttime Lights, Vegetation Real-time, Fires - Real-time and Earth in True Color (daily) - Real-time.",

    "description": "The true color imagery from the Suomi NPP satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument, used in this dataset, is like looking at a picture of Earth. However, this imagery is not photography. It uses three of the instrument's 21 channels to create photorealistic images of the planet. The images are made from combining three color channels: red, green and blue (called \"RGB\"). Since the VIIRS channels 5, 4 and 3 are sensitive to the red, green and blue wavelengths of light, respectively, they can be combined to create these types of images. Combining other bands, or the same ones in different combinations, results in a completely different image. These types of RGB composites are used for many applications, such as differentiating snow/ice from cloud, ash/smoke from cloud, or even the boundaries between warm and cold air masses.\n\nThe VIIRS true color images are processed at 750 meters per pixel and are available on a daily basis, with a year's worth of images on Science On a Sphere. With this true color real-time view of the Earth, the current state of vegetation and sea ice concentration can be seen. Changes over the course of the year can also be observed. The diagonal streaks that can sometimes be seen across the oceans are called sunglint, which is the result of sunlight reflecting off the ocean surface at the same angle as the field of the view of the satellite sensor.",

    "description": "NOAA's next generation geostationary weather satellites, GOES-East and GOES-West, have some pretty amazing new capabilities. One is the ability to generate images of the western hemisphere in near true color, what we are calling \"geocolor.\" Using an algorithm created by our partners at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, the geocolor imagery enhancement shown here displays geostationary satellite data in different ways depending on whether it is day or night.\n\nIn daytime imagery, land and shallow-water features appear as they do in true-color imagery. Using the satellites' red and blue light channels, along with a simulated green color, a near-perfect RGB image is formed. This is more advanced than the traditional Clouds - Real-time imagery also available on SOS \u2013 where a single cloud channel (infrared) is simply mapped on a Blue Marble base map. Considerable details are being lost in that process.\n\nIn the nighttime imagery, the satellites' high resolution infrared imagery is used. Blue cloud colors indicate low-level clouds, and white colors indicate higher level clouds associated with severe weather. These are mapped with a nighttime lights layer. When combined with the daylight imagery, it creates a natural transition from day to night.\n\nNot only do GOES-East and GOES-West satellites provide 4x the number of wavelength channels that can be seen, but they also take imagery much faster. The older GOES satellites took images of the hemisphere every 3 hours. GOES-East and West can image the hemisphere in 10 minutes.",

NASA scientists are looking for \"Goldilocks Planets\" that have temperatures not too hot or too cold to allow liquid water. By looking within our own solar system, we identify reasons neighboring planets and our moon lack conditions for life. Then we look at Earth: how the presence of liquid water, reflective surfaces such as polar ice caps, and the chemical composition of our atmosphere all contribute to keeping Earth's energy budget in balance.\n\n- Earth reflects an average 30% of incoming solar energy back to space\n\n- Earth's atmosphere absorbs about 20% of incoming solar energy\n\n- About 50% of solar energy reaches the land and oceans and warms them\n\n- Earth emits 70% of incoming energy back to space as heat (infrared radiation)\n\nThis movie gives an overview of NASA's Search for Goldilocks Planets and can be used on its own or within a docent show as an introduction.

    "description": "Overview\n\nFor the past 15 years, satellites that measure the color of the ocean have given us a view of sea surface phytoplankton which form the base of the food web and half of all the oxygen we breathe. These satellite data are being used to understand fish distributions and why some fisheries suddenly collapse. Read on for more information about the relationships between climate cycles like El Ni\u00f1o and their effects on phytoplankton and fish distributions.\n\nThe Impact\n\nPhytoplankton abundance is controlled by the availability of sunlight and nutrients. Winds over the ocean drive currents away from the coast and equator, creating a void at the surface that's filled by nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean upwelling to the sunlit surface.\n\nCombining satellite data with samples collected from the ocean enables scientists to better understand where these microscopic plants live and support different ecosystems and how physical and chemical changes affect them.\n\nSeasonal changes are most obvious. Slower changes are also apparent, one of the largest being El Ni\u00f1o in the tropical Pacific, with an approximately 5 year cycle. El Ni\u00f1o causes reduced upwelling, with warmer water and less phytoplankton; its opposite phase is called La Ni\u00f1a with more phytoplankton than normal.\n\nSince phytoplankton form the base of the food web in the ocean, they impact animals higher up the chain. A major consequence of El Ni\u00f1o is the loss of commercially important species from their usual location: anchovies around South America, squid off of California, salmon around the Pacific, and others. Not only fish are impacted, but animals that depend upon them such as sea lions, seals and sea birds experience famine.\n\nUnderstanding El Ni\u00f1o and other natural and man-made causes for fisheries collapse will guide decisions about how to help them recover.",

    "description": "Overview\n\nAs part of National Severe Weather Preparedness week, the EarthNow team is releasing its latest featured story, regarding extreme weather and climate change. Three out of four adults in America say that global warming is affecting weather in the United States. Global warming is also being blamed on changing weather patterns internationally, including by delegates at the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. This piece explores what the science says about these changes and extreme weather.\n\nFor more information on how you can \"be a force of nature,\" visit NOAA's Weather-Ready Nation page.\n\nThe Science and Impact\n\nEarth is a water planet. Oceans and lakes cover three quarters of the Earth's surface, as depicted in this pie chart.\n\nWater is the only substance on Earth that exists naturally as a solid, liquid, and gas. The gas phase of water is referred to as water vapor. Did you know that water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere?\n\nWhile we can't see water vapor in the atmosphere, instruments on satellites can. Storms in the mid-latitudes draw the warm moisture from the tropics. Weather patterns help redistribute heat and moisture around the planet. This means that the availability of water vapor fuels or limits all atmospheric processes.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how water vapor fuels tropical cyclones, also called hurricanes and typhoons. Rising air over warm ocean waters carries water vapor upward into colder air. As this happens, warm moist air near the surface rushes in to take its place, creating the strong winds associated with hurricanes. As the warm air rises, the water vapor cools and condenses into clouds, releasing heat. The added heat accelerates this process. The rotating Earth causes the storm to begin spinning. Once a storm moves over land, it weakens rapidly largely because the storm lacks the moisture and heat the ocean provided.\n\nLooking at typhoons and hurricanes over time, researchers see a trend. In a warming world with warmer oceans, there is more evaporation and fuel for storms, leading to more powerful storms. The warmer air can also hold more moisture, meaning heavier rainfall. Finally, rising sea levels mean higher storm surges and more flooding. Basic science points to bigger storms, changing weather patterns, and more extremes.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? If you live near the coast, like a lot of people, there is an increased vulnerability to storms due to rising sea levels. For example, Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the highly populated Northeastern United States. Sandy caused an estimated $77 billion in damage in the U.S.\n\nBut even if you don't live near the coastline, research shows that Earth's changing climate is altering the frequency, intensity, extent, and duration of other extreme weather events around the world.\n\nWherever you live, it's important to understand the type of hazardous weather that might affect you and your family.",

    "description": "Overview\n\nOver the past several decades, the number of extreme weather events has increased. During those same years, the Arctic has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. The rapid Arctic warming is referred to as Arctic Amplification, and research suggests that it may be blamed for some of the extreme weather episodes.\n\nAbout the jet stream\n\nThe temperature differences between the cold poles and warm tropics, combined with the Earth's rotation, cause air to flow eastward fastest over the midlatitudes, where most of us live. This is called the jet stream.\n\nApproaching North America, the jet stream moves northward over the Rocky Mountains, then dips southward forming a trough toward the East Coast, then northward as a ridge over the Atlantic Ocean. It continues in a similar long wave pattern over Europe, Asia, and the Pacific. Storms develop and track along the jet stream, pushing cold air south and warm air north.\n\nWhat is Arctic amplification?\n\nDuring the past few decades, general warming in the atmosphere has accelerated Arctic ice melt, leading to more seasonal ice cover which is not as white and absorbs more sunlight, in turn causing more warming. The Arctic has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. This is Arctic Amplification.\n\nEffects of Arctic amplification\n\nScientists have observed that the reduced temperature difference between the North Pole and tropics is associated with slower west-to-east jet stream movement and a greater north-south dip in its path. This pattern causes storms to stall and intensify, rather than move away as they normally used to do. At midlatitudes, more extreme weather results from this new pattern, including droughts, floods, colds spells, and heat waves.",

    "description": "This dataset was developed as part of the EarthNow project, and shows the changes in the tropical zone boundaries over the last three decades.\n\nThe tropics are defined by the Easterly winds and are indicated in orange. They are the central belt of the world that is traditionally defined by a warm moist climate. In order to define the boundary of the tropics, satellites are used to measure the total column ozone differences between the tropics and the subtropics. This amount is then compared to past measurements and used to define the changing tropical boundary. In the past 30 years the boundary of the tropics has shifted on average 10 degrees latitude. The blue line is the tropical boundary of 1980-1984 while the red line in the boundary of 2008-2012. This expansion is significant, as it spreads the threat of tropical diseases as well as drought areas within the subtropics. This is even more important as this region of the world is home to most of the Earth's human inhabitants. Due to this shift, increased drought is forecasted for much of the world including southwestern United States, the Middle East, and southern Australia. These changes will also spread tropical diseases such as dengue fever and others, as there have been recent outbreaks in Florida, Portugal, and Russia. Understanding these changes in climate boundaries will offer great insight into the best ways to face these new conditions including vaccinations, food production, and urban development.\n\nThrough a collaboration with the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites (CICS-MD), and the NOAA Environmental Visualization Lab, EarthNow allows Science On a Sphere (SOS) institutions to go beyond the scientific facts to create meaningful visitor experiences about weather and climate connections.

    "description": "This dataset was developed as part of the EarthNow project. A new technology called fracking releases natural gas from shale formations and could supply domestic energy demand for the next hundred years. Fracking is good news for some and bad news for others.\n\nThere are two big concerns with increased use of fossil fuels:\n\nAs the world population grows dependent on electricity and motorized transportation, people seek new energy sources and ways to reach sources that used to be too difficult to tap. New technology has made it possible to recover gas from shale. The bad news is that each well uses about 3 million gallons of water laced with chemical additives to fracture the shale. Improper handling of wastewater could contaminate groundwater or deplete fresh water aquifers in drought-prone areas. Another issue is that fracking waste water disposal can sometimes trigger earthquakes. According to the US Geological Survey, out of 40,000 waste water wells only a few have caused earthquakes of any concern. A 4.0 earthquake in Youngstown, Ohio in 2011 and tremors in other places that never registered them before have people on edge. The good news is natural gas burns cleaner than coal, releasing less pollution and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. It also reduces US dependence on foreign oil.\n\nMany open questions remain about the risks and benefits of fracking to release natural gas from shale, and they affect all of us through the energy we use, the water we drink and the air we breathe.\n\nThrough a collaboration with the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS), the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites (CICS-MD), and the NOAA Environmental Visualization Lab, EarthNow allows Science On a Sphere (SOS) institutions to go beyond the scientific facts to create meaningful visitor experiences about weather and climate connections.

This measurement has been used since the 1970's with the introduction of more modern broadband seismometers. To read more about the Richter vs. Moment magnitude scales, click here. or watch a video here.\n\nMoment magnitude numbers scale such that energy release increases by a factor of about 32 for each whole magnitude number.

The earthquake hypocenters first appear as flashes then remain as colored circles before shrinking with time so as not to obscure subsequent earthquakes. The size of the circle represents the earthquake magnitude while the color represents its depth within the earth. At the end of the animation it will first show all quakes in this 15-year period. Next, it will show only those earthquakes greater than magnitude 6.5, the smallest earthquake size known to make a tsunami. Finally it will only show those earthquakes with magnitudes of magnitude 8.0 or larger, the \"great\" earthquakes most likely to pose a tsunami threat when they occur under the ocean or near a coastline and when they are shallow within the earth (less than 100 km or 60 mi. deep).\n\nThis time period includes some remarkable events. Several large earthquakes caused devastating tsunamis, including 9.1 magnitude in Sumatra (26 December 2004), 8.1 magnitude in Samoa (29 September 2009), 8.8 magnitude in Chile (27 February 2010), and 9.0 magnitude off of Japan (11 March 2011).

Other, much smaller earthquakes also occur away from plate boundaries such as those related to volcanic activity in Hawaii or those related to wastewater injection wells in Oklahoma.\n\nYou can view a YouTube version of this animation here.",

    "description": "Most of Earth's earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur at the boundaries of the tectonic plates. This dataset shows all earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 or greater from 1960 through 2010. The earthquakes are illustrated with a large white dot at the time of the event. The size of the dot is proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake. A musical tone is generated for the larger events. The larger the earthquake, the lower the tone. The white dots eventually turn gray and slowly shrink to single-pixel dots.\n\nLikewise, volcanic eruptions are shown as red triangles as they occur. Like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions are assigned a magnitude called the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) based on the volume of material ejected during the eruption. These magnitudes run from one to eight, with none greater than five in this dataset. A given eruption might go through several changes of size during the eruption. The sound generated when a volcano erupts is made by percussion instruments, with the largest\u2014a magnitude five-accompanied by the sound of a crashing cymbal. For example, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 is accompanied by the sound of a crashing cymbal. Unlike earthquakes that last (at most) a few minutes, an eruption can go on for years. As long as it is erupting, it is shown as a red triangle. When the eruption is done, the triangle disappears. Dates are displayed along with the number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that have occurred since 1960.",

    "description": "It is estimated that there are 500,000 detectable earthquakes in the world each year. Of those, 100,000 can be felt and 100 of them cause damage. Anything that causes seismic waves to radiate throughout the Earth is an earthquake. The cause of earthquakes can be natural, such as one tectonic plate slipping below another, or anthropogenic (cause by humans), such as drilling for fossil fuels, extraction of minerals, huge explosions, and the collapse of large buildings. The surface of the Earth is composed of a mosaic of tectonic plates moving with respect to each other. When two plates glide past one another, a stress builds up at the boundary. When that stress reaches a critical level, the boundary slips and the result is an earthquake. Because most natural earthquakes occur due to slipping plates, the boundaries between tectonic plates are \"hot spots\" for earthquakes. The magnitude of earthquakes is measured by the Richter magnitude scale. It is a base-10 logarithm scale of the ground motion caused by the earthquake. Each increase of 1 in magnitude represents 10 times more ground motion.\n\nThis historical dataset highlights the locations of the top ten recorded earthquakes, with additional smaller earthquakes as well. The top ten earthquakes are in yellow text, and all the others are in red text. Each bullseye represents an earthquake, with the size of the bullseye proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake. The coasts along the Pacific Ocean are a particularly active region known as the Ring of Fire. In the area, the Pacific Plate meets many other plates, creating boundaries conducive to earthquake formation. Here is the top 20 list of earthquakes according the to the\n\nUnited States Geological Survey",

    "description": "This animation shows every recorded earthquake in sequence as they occurred from January 1, 1901, through December 31, 2000, at a rate of 1 year per second. The earthquake hypocenters first appear as flashes then remain as colored circles before shrinking with time so as not to obscure subsequent earthquakes. The size of the circle represents the earthquake magnitude while the color represents its depth within the earth. At the end of the animation it will first show all quakes in this 100-year period. Next, it will show only those earthquakes greater than magnitude 6.5, the smallest earthquake size known to make a tsunami. It will then show only those earthquakes with magnitudes of 8.0 or larger, the \"great\" earthquakes most likely to pose a tsunami threat when they occur under the ocean or near a coastline and when they are shallow within the earth (less than 100 km or 60 mi. deep). The animation concludes by showing the plate boundary faults responsible for the majority of all of these earthquakes.\n\nThe era of modern earthquake seismology\u2014the scientific study of earthquakes\u2014began in the 20th Century with the invention of the seismometer and its deployment in instrument networks to record and measure earthquakes as they occur. Therefore, when the animation begins only the largest earthquakes appear as they were the only ones that could be detected at great distances with the few available instruments available at the time. But as time progresses, more and more seismometers were deployed and smaller and smaller earthquakes could be recorded. For example, note how in the 1930\u2019s many small earthquakes suddenly seem to appear in California, but this illusion results from the installation of more and more instruments in that region. Likewise, there appears to be a jump in the number of earthquakes globally in the 1970's when seismology took another leap forward with advances in telecommunications and signal processing with digital computers, a trend that continues today.\n\n20th Century seismology revealed the global geographic distribution of earthquakes and helped to solidify the Theory of Plate Tectonics. Notice how earthquake epicenters do not occur randomly in space but form patterns over the earth\u2019s surface, revealing the boundaries between tectonic plates as shown toward the end of this animation. This time period also includes some remarkable events, including those that generated devastating tsunamis:\n\nThese earthquakes represent some of the largest ever recorded. Note how they all occur at a particular type of plate boundary, subduction zones where tectonic plates collide, so these are the regions where we expect future devastating tsunamis to be generated.\n\nYou can also view a YouTube version of this animation.\n\nPaper Globe Cutouts are available for this dataset!",

    "description": "Earthquakes occur naturally everyday. Anything that causes seismic waves to radiate throughout the Earth is an earthquake. There are two main types of earthquakes, tectonic and anthropogenic (caused by humans). Tectonic earthquakes are naturally occurring and are caused by earth movement. The surface of the Earth is composed of a mosaic of tectonic plates moving with respect to each other. When two plates glide past one another, a stress builds up at the boundary. When that stress reaches a critical level, the boundary slips and the result is an earthquake. The traces of repeated slips are known as fault lines. Anthropogenic earthquakes can be caused by drilling for fossil fuels, extraction of minerals, huge explosions, and the collapse of large buildings.\n\nMost earthquakes are small enough to hardly be noticed; however, some can be very powerful causing widespread death and destruction and can even trigger tsunamis. The Richter magnitude scale was created to rate the strength and magnitude of earthquakes. It is a base-10 logarithm scale of ground motion 100km from the epicenter. Each increase of 1 magnitude means 10 times greater ground motion. To measure the amount of energy that was released during an Earthquake, a base 32 logarithm scale is used. This real-time dataset shows the earthquakes that daily happen around the world that are greater than 2.5 on the Richter scale. With the current database from the USGS, many earthquakes outside of the United States under 4-5 magnitude on the Richter scale are not reported. The size of the circle is proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake, with bigger values on the Richter scale represented by bigger circles. The coloring of the circles is based on the depth of the earthquake below the surface according to the provided color bar. After an earthquake occurs, the representing circle fades out over a seven day period. This dataset is updated hourly.",

The Geographic North Pole is defined by the latitude 90\u00b0 N and is the axis of the Earth's rotation. The Magnetic North Pole is where the Earth's magnetic field points vertically downward. The Earth creates its own magnetic field from the electric currents created in the liquid iron-nickel core.\n\nCompass needles point in the direction of the magnetic field lines, which is generally different from the direction to the Geographic North Pole. The compass pointing direction can also differ from the direction to the Magnetic North Pole since the magnetic field lines are not just circles connecting the magnetic poles. This dataset shows lines of equal magnetic declination (isogonic lines) measured in degrees east (positive) or west (negative) of True North. The green line is where the declination equals zero and the direction of True North and Magnetic North are equal (agonic line). The Magnetic North and South Poles are indicated by the green circles. It is important to know the magnetic declination when using a compass to navigate so that the direction of True North can be determined. Since the 1970's, the movement of the Magnetic North Pole has accelerated, which is noticeable in this dataset.\n\nIn this figure and animation, the magnetic field from 1590 to 1890 is given by the GUFM-1 model of Jackson et al. (2000), while the field from 1900 to 2025 is given by the 13th generation of the International Geomagnetic Reference Field. Between 1890 and 1900, a smooth transition was imposed between the models. This visualization uses a transverse aspect of the Plate Car\u00e9e projection to minimize distortion near the poles.",

    "description": "Eating Water is a three-minute autorun film about the challenges of feeding a growing world population. Featuring researcher Kate Brauman from the Global Landscapes Initiative at the University of Minnesota, the film reveals an intriguing fact as it opens: we \"eat\" more water than we drink. The water it takes to produce our food far outstrips the water we drink and use for other purposes. The show is built around two datasets: (1) mapping the land used for farming and grazing around the world; and (2) agricultural efficiency, as measured in how much corn is produced per liter of water. Because we're already using virtually all available farmland, the challenge in the coming decades will be to feed two billion more people by 2050 on the land already used for agriculture. Climate change will challenge our ability to do that, because we don't know how rainfall patterns will be affected around the world.\n\nEating Water is one in a series of four SOS films that use data visualizations and actual scientists to tell stories about the impacts of climate change. No other single natural factor affects Earth as much as humans now do. Separately, each film stands alone, focusing on a single area of human impact, and features a researcher working in this area. Together, the films tell a bigger story about the human-generated effects of global climate change.\n\nThis movie is available in English and Spanish.\n\nLength of dataset: 3:11",

    "description": "Rather than plotting sea surface temperatures, sea surface temperature anomalies have been plotted here to show the dramatic departures from normal that are associated with El Nino and La Nina from 1980 - 1999. El Nino is the warming of the Pacific Ocean off of the western coast of South America near Ecuador and Peru. It is called El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, referring to the Christ child because the phenomena usually occurs near Christmas time. The opposite of El Nino is La Nina, or little girl in Spanish, which is a cooling of the Pacific Ocean. The red shading signifies a warming of the ocean by 5-10\u00b0F, the green shading is normal and the blue shading is a cooling of the ocean by 5-10\u00b0F.\n\nIn strong El Nino years, a prominent red band indicating warmer water extends out into the Pacific Ocean. Observed El Nino years include 1982-1983, 1986-1987, 1991-1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997-1998. The series of El Nino\u2019s in the early 1990\u2019s was unusual because they were spaced so close together, though they were all relatively weak. The most notable El Nino years include 1982-1983, 1986-1987 and 1997-1998. In fact, the 1997-1998 El Nino was so strong that it started to gain national attention. The effects of a strong El Nino include a wetter than normal season in most of the United States, though the Pacific Northwest states tend to be drier. An El Nino affects the weather worldwide. Indonesia and the Philippines, for example, are drier than normal during El Nino and have increased risk of forest fires while East Africa experiences much wetter conditions from March through May. La Nina has the opposite effect as El Nino, causing the United States to be drier than normal. Samples of a strong El Nino and La Nina occurrence are available as additional datasets. In these datasets, the land is true color shaded and a mask has been applied to highlight only the region off of South America.",

    "description": "El Nino is the warming of the Pacific Ocean off of the western coast of South America near Ecuador and Peru. It is called El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, referring to the Christ child because the phenomena was originally noticed near Christmas time. The opposite of El Nino is La Nina, or little girl in Spanish, which is a cooling of the Pacific Ocean. Because the Earth system is interconnected, changes in the ocean cause changes in the atmosphere. El Nino and La Nina events not only impact ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific, but also global weather. The occurrence of El Nino and La Nina is not predictable, but on average occurs once every four year and usually lasts for about 18 months.\n\nThe effects of El Nino and La Nina vary by season. This dataset consists of four frames that show the winter and summer effects of both El Nino and La Nina. The effects of a strong El Nino include a wetter and cooler than normal winter season in the southern United States, though the Pacific Northwest states tend to be warmer. Along the equatorial Pacific, conditions tend to warmer and wetter. Parts of southern Africa tend to be drier and warmer along with southeast Asia. During the summer, El Nino causes southeast Asia to be dry with wetter conditions in the middle of the Pacific. Also, warmer than normal conditions exist along the western coast of South America. A La Nina winter has the opposite impact of an El Nino winter. The results are dry and warm conditions in the southern United States with dry and cool conditions along the equatorial Pacific and a wetter than normal southeast Asia. During the summer, La Nina causes the western coast of South America and southeast Asia to be cooler.\n\nRead more about El Nino and La Nina from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center:",

    "description": "Enceladus is not only Saturn\u2019s brightest moon, but it also has the highest albedo (reflectivity) of any body in the solar system. This moon reflects almost 100% of the sunlight that hits the surface. One reason for this reflectivity is the fresh, clean ice that makes up the relatively young surface of the moon. There are at least five different terrains visible on Enceladus including craters, smooth plains, cracks, ridges, and other deformations.\n\nThe chilly average temperature of -330\u00b0F would lead one to believe that this moon is composed of solid ice. However, the huge variations in the surface led scientists to believe that there is an active liquid core, with some volcanism which has resurfaced the planet. One explanation for the heat required to maintain the liquid is the tidal mechanisms exerted on the moon by Saturn and the surrounding moons, similar to the tidal forces that heat Jupiter\u2019s moon, Io.",

    "description": "Many datasets have been created by utilizing the ETOPO2 dataset, which was generated from digital data bases of seafloor and land elevations on a 2-minute latitude/longitude grid (1 minute of latitude = 1 nautical mile, or 1.15 statute mile). The ETOPO2 is a combination of satellite altimetry observations, shipboard echo-sounding measurements, data from the Digital Bathymetric Data Base Variable Resolution and data from the GLOBE project which has a global digital elevation model.\n\nThis ETOPO2 was made using Landsat data. The Landsat program began with it's first launch on July 23, 1972. The most recent, Landsat 7, was launched on April 15, 1999. The instruments on the Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images, archived in the United States and at Landsat receiving stations around the world, are a unique resource for global change research and applications in agriculture, cartography, geology, forestry, regional planning, surveillance, education and national security. Landsat 7 data has eight spectral bands with spatial resolutions ranging from 15 to 60 meters; the temporal resolution is 16 days.\n\nETOPO2 with Landsat shows the intricate bathymetry of the Earth. The longest mountain range in the world, the global mid-oceanic ridge system, can be found on the ocean floors and runs for approximately 37,000 miles. All of the mid-ocean ridges of the world can be regarded as a continuous oceanic ridge system. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which cuts through the Atlantic Ocean, has peaks that break the waters surface to form islands. The ridge joins the Indian Ridge which is to the east of Africa. All of these ridges are the result of plate tectonics. The plates in the Atlantic Ocean are slowly drifting apart causing the Atlantic Ocean to widen at a rate of 5 - 10 cm per year. Other notable features on the seafloor are the impressive trenches that have formed where one tectonic plate dives beneath another. The Marianas Trench between Japan and Australia is the deepest spot in the world\u2019s oceans with a depth of 36,201 feet. The deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean is in the Puerto Rico Trench, off the coast of Puerto Rico. It has recorded depths of 28,232 feet.",

The deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean is in the Puerto Rico Trench, off the coast of Puerto Rico. It has recorded depths of 28,232 feet.",

    "description": "The most interesting feature of Europa, Jupiter\u2019s sixth moon, is the incredibly smooth surface with relatively few craters. There are only three craters that have a diameter greater than 3.1 miles. This is an incredibly small amount for the moon which is just slightly less than the size of Earth\u2019s Moon. Scientists believe that the surface of Europa is relatively young because of that fact. Another notable feature is the basically level surface with very little change in altitude across the moon. While there is almost no elevation change on Europa to observe, there are distinct lines which encircle the moon. The latest theory is that these markings are from volcanoes or geysers.\n\nEuropa is one of only five moons in the solar system known to have an atmosphere. This atmosphere is incredibly small with a pressure of only 1x10-8mb compared to the average of approximately 1000mb on Earth. An ocean that is up to 30 miles deep is thought to exist under the surface layer of Europa. Another theory regarding the distinct markings on Europa is that they are the result of the moon\u2019s crust expanding and fracturing causing the cracks to fill in with water and freeze.",

    "description": "One of the objectives of NASA's Kepler Mission is to establish the number of planetary systems outside of the Solar System that contain Earth-like planets. At a minimum, an Earth-like planet would be rocky (vs. gaseous), be about the same radius as Earth, and exist within the habitable zone of its host star. The habitable zone is the region in which liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. Liquid water is a key ingredient to life, so planets found within this zone are more likely to be habitable worlds.\n\nThis artist's concept shows what a water-covered Earth-analog planet might look like. Rising out of a deep blue ocean are several land masses with distinct climate regions, including arid deserts, tropical rain forests, lush green valleys, frozen tundras, and icy polar caps. Lakes and rivers are also visible on various continents, as well as steep mountain ranges. Wispy groups of clouds can be seen forming throughout this planet's mostly clear atmosphere.\n\nAlthough the Kepler spacecraft is not capable of detecting such detail, it has discovered over 3,200 exoplanet candidates. More than 270 of those are in the habitable zone of their stars. Could any of those be Earth's twin?\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Kepler spacecraft measures the light output of 150,000 stars simultaneously. The data from each star is then analyzed in order to look for periodic drops in the light curve being emitted. These drops in brightness could indicate the presence of an orbiting planet passing in front of its host star, blocking some of its light. This is called a transit. Three or more transits of equal periods are needed to catalog an object as an exoplanet candidate.\n\nLearn more on the Kepler Mission website: http://kepler.nasa.gov/",

    "description": "The first \"rocky\" planet to be discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission, Kepler-10b is an exoplanet 1.4 times the size of our Earth. An exoplanet is any identified planet outside of our own Solar System. As of June 2013, there have been 866 exoplanets identified, located around 671 stars, nearly all within the Milky Way Galaxy. Kepler-10b has a density 4.6 times that of Earth, or similar to an iron dumbbell. This planet orbits its star, Kepler-10, once every 0.84 days (20 hours) and is 20 times closer to its star than Mercury is to our Sun. At such close range, Kepler-10b does not lie in the habitable zone, the region in which liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. Therefore, it is unlikely any life exists on its surface. The planet is also tidally locked to its parent star, meaning only one side ever faces the star.\n\nKepler-10 was the first star discovered by the Kepler Mission that could potentially have a small planet transiting across it. This was later confirmed by observational data from the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. This artist's visualization suggests the rocky composition of Kepler-10b with no bands of gas present. Being tidally locked, the surface on the star-facing side is thought to be molten and glowing, while the surface on the side facing away from the star is be solid and rocky.\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Kepler spacecraft measures the light output of 150,000 stars simultaneously.

    "description": "Kepler-9b is a gaseous exoplanet similar in size to Jupiter, but with only one-quarter of its mass. An exoplanet is any identified planet outside of our own Solar System. As of June 2013, there have been 866 exoplanets identified, located around 671 stars, nearly all within the Milky Way Galaxy. This artist's visualization of Kepler-9b shows the hypothetical bands of ammonia, sulfur and methane gases, caused by high winds churning across the planet's surface.\n\nKepler-9b takes a speedy 19 days to complete an orbit. By contrast, in our own Solar System, Mercury takes 88 days to orbit the Sun and is about three times as far from the Sun as Kepler-9b is from its host star. Since it orbits so close, Kepler-9b is considered a \"hot Jupiter\" - large like Jupiter, but hot like Mercury. Kepler-9b is in orbital resonance at a 1:2 ratio with a smaller, outer sibling. The 1:2 ratio means that for every one orbit that its sibling makes, Kepler-9b makes two orbits. This is the first verified example of two exoplanets in orbital resonance.\n\nLaunched in 2009, the Kepler spacecraft measures the light output of 150,000 stars simultaneously. The data from each star is then analyzed in order to look for periodic drops in the light curve being emitted. These drops in brightness could indicate the presence of an orbiting planet passing in front of its host star, blocking some of its light. This is called a transit. Three or more transits of equal periods are needed to catalog an object as an exoplanet candidate.\n\nLearn more on the Kepler Mission website: http://kepler.nasa.gov/",

    "description": "A planet that orbits a star outside the solar system is an exoplanet.\n\nImagine a place with not one, not two, but 7 Earth-sized planets orbiting a single star. TRAPPIST-1 is an Ultra-Cool Dwarf Star. This artist's concept shows what the planet might look like. To learn more about the how artists' took tiny bits of data and made a vivid picture, read here.\n\nTRAPPIST-1 is a system about 40 light years away from Earth (12 parsecs) in the Constellation, Aquarius. The 7 Earth-sized Exoplanets are currently (March, 2017) labeled, \"b, c, d, e, f, g, and h\". In order based on proximity to their star (\"b\" is closet to TRAPPIST-1). The Largest planets, g and b are about 10% larger than the Earth. The Smallest planets, d and h are about 25% smaller than the Earth. According to NASA/Caltech's Exoplanet Archive, as of 2017 there are more than 3,450 confirmed exoplanets in the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nIt is likely that most, if not all, of the exoplanets keep the same one side of their surface facing their star at all times. This phenomenon is called Tidal Locking. This is the same phenomenon we observe with our on Moon in Relation to the Earth. Only one side is ever facing us. On the exoplanets this would cause massive temperature differences across their surfaces. This also could, (given the right circumstances) mean there is a possibility of finding liquid water on any of these exoplanets. This is why each of these exoplanets on SOS appears to have one side in shadow. Unlike our moon, the entirety of these planets would likely not ever see the sun.\n\nThough we do not believe any of these exoplanets have moons, as they are too close to their star, if you were to stand on the surface of one of these planets, you would clearly see the other planets in the system and some of them, at certain times would appear even larger than our moon appears to us. This is because TRAPPIST-1 is only a little larger than Jupiter, and its planets orbit only a little further away than that of Jupiter's moons.\n\nInterplanetary Trips would be measured in Days in TRAPPIST-1, unlike in our solar system, where we have to measure them in Months and Years. It only takes 1.5 days for the innermost planet to orbit it's star.\n\nIn May 2016 astronomers using the Trappist Telescope (x2 Belgian optic robotic telescope) in the La Silla Observatory in Chile first identified 3 Earth-Sized planets. The Spitzer Space Telescope then followed-up on this discovery. Spitzer was uniquely up to the challenge as it is finely sensitive to the cool glow of the dwarf star. Spitzer confirmed 2 of the three planets and found the 3rd planet to actually be 3 different planets, it then went on to discover 2 more planets, leading to a total of 7 exoplanets. NASA published their findings in the journal, Nature on Feb. 23, 2017.\n\nSpitzer studied the TRAPPIST-1 Star for over 21 days nearly continuously (500 Hours), pausing only to send data back to Earth. Spitzer looked for tiny dips in the star's brightness, as the circling planets passed in front of the star while in transit. Hubble then followed up on Spitzer's data to peer into the system to look for the chemical fingerprint of Hydrogen gas in the atmospheres of the planets. So far Hubble has not found evidence for hydrogen gas in the atmospheres, which is a good indicator that these planets are not gas planets, but terrestrial, rocky bodied planets.\n\nSpitzer Space Telescope launched in 2003 was designed to last at least 2.5 years. 13 years (2016) later Spitzer has operated far beyond the scope of its original mission. Spitzer uses infrared vision (IR) to peer into the cosmos and see it in new ways. It is able to see through the dust in space. Because of this, it originally was used to peer through the dust and debris, deep into stellar nurseries where stars are born. It has been more recently used to map IR temperature of exoplanets, create a 360 degree panorama image of the Milky Way, find a new ring of Saturn hundreds of times larger than any other ring previously known. Spitzer is now expected to last past the launch of its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, in 2018.\n\nAlready more than 130 million miles away, Spitzer faces communication challenges with NASA because of distance. In mid-2009 the telescope ran out of coolant, however the engineers' design still allows it to operate one of its three cameras. (Coolant is needed so the ship's own heat and IR do not interfere with the data collected by the cameras. For all three cameras to function as designed, the temp had to remain at just 5 degrees above absolute zero.) Unlike other orbital telescopes like Hubble, Spitzer was design to move away from the Earth slowly, in a Earth-Trailing orbit. (Because of the massive amount of IR light waves that the Earth would radiate onto the telescope, making it hard to see clearly through.)",

This phenomenon is called Tidal Locking. This is the same phenomenon we observe with our on Moon in Relation to the Earth. Only one side is ever facing us. On the exoplanets this would cause massive temperature differences across their surfaces. This also could, (given the right circumstances) mean there is a possibility of finding liquid water on any of these exoplanets. This is why each of these exoplanets on SOS appears to have one side in shadow. Unlike our moon, the entirety of these planets would likely not ever see the sun.\n\nThough we do not believe any of these exoplanets have moons, as they are too close to their star, if you were to stand on the surface of one of these planets, you would clearly see the other planets in the system and some of them, at certain times would appear even larger than our moon appears to us. This is because TRAPPIST-1 is only a little larger than Jupiter, and its planets orbit only a little further away than that of Jupiter's moons.\n\nInterplanetary Trips would be measured in Days in TRAPPIST-1, unlike in our solar system, where we have to measure them in Months and Years. It only takes 1.5 days for the innermost planet to orbit it's star.\n\nIn May 2016 astronomers using the Trappist Telescope (x2 Belgian optic robotic telescope) in the La Silla Observatory in Chile first identified 3 Earth-Sized planets. The Spitzer Space Telescope then followed-up on this discovery. Spitzer was uniquely up to the challenge as it is finely sensitive to the cool glow of the dwarf star. Spitzer confirmed 2 of the three planets and found the 3rd planet to actually be 3 different planets, it then went on to discover 2 more planets, leading to a total of 7 exoplanets. NASA published their findings in the journal, Nature on Feb. 23, 2017.\n\nSpitzer studied the TRAPPIST-1 Star for over 21 days nearly continuously (500 Hours), pausing only to send data back to Earth. Spitzer looked for tiny dips in the star's brightness, as the circling planets passed in front of the star while in transit. Hubble then followed up on Spitzer's data to peer into the system to look for the chemical fingerprint of Hydrogen gas in the atmospheres of the planets. So far Hubble has not found evidence for hydrogen gas in the atmospheres, which is a good indicator that these planets are not gas planets, but terrestrial, rocky bodied planets.\n\nSpitzer Space Telescope launched in 2003 was designed to last at least 2.5 years. 13 years (2016) later Spitzer has operated far beyond the scope of its original mission. Spitzer uses infrared vision (IR) to peer into the cosmos and see it in new ways. It is able to see through the dust in space. Because of this, it originally was used to peer through the dust and debris, deep into stellar nurseries where stars are born. It has been more recently used to map IR temperature of exoplanets, create a 360 degree panorama image of the Milky Way, find a new ring of Saturn hundreds of times larger than any other ring previously known. Spitzer is now expected to last past the launch of its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, in 2018.\n\nAlready more than 130 million miles away, Spitzer faces communication challenges with NASA because of distance. In mid-2009 the telescope ran out of coolant, however the engineers' design still allows it to operate one of its three cameras. (Coolant is needed so the ship's own heat and IR do not interfere with the data collected by the cameras. For all three cameras to function as designed, the temp had to remain at just 5 degrees above absolute zero.) Unlike other orbital telescopes like Hubble, Spitzer was design to move away from the Earth slowly, in a Earth-Trailing orbit.

It was once thought that the ocean depths were devoid of life, the seafloor, a barren, empty plain. However, advances in ocean science technologies are taking humans to previously unexplored waters, revealing unimaginable subsea landscapes, teaming with life. The compelling story behind these technologies, the people that operate them, the scientists who use them, and the amazing discoveries they make together are highlighted in a new, innovative SOS program developed by the Inner Space Center (ISC) at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography (URI/GSO).  It features deep-sea encounters, creature discoveries, and interesting habitats; engaging, scientists\u2019 audio commentaries; and imaginative technology visualizations and animations, all linked via inventive, sphere-based storytelling. This program is intended for use at informal science education institutions with SOS installations and incorporates options for content expansion and audience engagement with science interpreters.\n\nProduced by The Inner Space Center\nIn Partnership with 42\u00b0 North Media and NOAA\u2019s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research\nFunding Provided by National Marine Sanctuary Foundation\nMusic composed by Robert Neufeld\nNarrated by Drew Patterson\nSpecial thanks Walter Smith, David Sandwell, Allan Adams, Mashkoor Malik, Jesse Varner, Nicole Raineault, NOAA\u2019s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, Ocean Exploration Trust, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution",

The blob had turned into a surprisingly detailed map of the world. Not only were continents visible, certain international borders were apparent as well. What really struck me, though, was knowing that the lines didn't represent coasts or rivers or political borders, but real human relationships.

    "description": "This dataset leads viewers on a narrated global tour of fire detections beginning in July 2002 and ending July 2011. The dataset also includes vegetation and snow cover data to show how fires respond to seasonal changes. The tour begins in Australia in 2002 by showing a network of massive grassland fires spreading across interior Australia as well as the greener Eucalyptus forests in the northern and eastern part of the continent. The tour then shifts to Asia where large numbers of agricultural fires are visible first in China in June 2004, then across a huge swath of Europe and western Russia in August, and then across India and Southeast Asia through the early part of 2005.\n\nIt moves next to Africa, the continent that has more abundant burning than any other. MODIS observations have shown that some 70 percent of the world's fires occur in Africa alone. In what's a fairly average burning season, the visualization shows a huge outbreak of savanna fires during the dry season in Central Africa in July, August, and September of 2006, driven mainly by agricultural activities but also by the fact that the region experiences more lightning than anywhere else in the world. The tour shifts next to South America where a steady flickering of fire is visible across much of the Amazon rainforest with peaks of activity in September and November of 2009. Almost all of the fires in the Amazon are the direct result of human activity, including slash-and-burn agriculture, because the high moisture levels in the region prevent natural fires from occurring.\n\nIt concludes in North America, a region where fires are comparatively rare. North American fires make up just 2 percent of the world's burned area each year. The fires that receive the most attention in the United States, the uncontrolled forest fires in the West, are less visible than the wave of agricultural fires prominent in the Southeast and along the Mississippi River Valley, but some of the large wildfires that struck Texas early spring 2011 are visible.\n\nThis dataset is available with and without audio.\n\nMore information is available on the Information for Resource Management (FIRMS)",

    "description": "Fires, both natural and manmade, are plotted in this daily imagery as a function of how many fires occurred within each 500 m pixel area over the selected time period. Satellites are sensitive to infrared (heat) energy and are able to detect the thermal signature of fires. This data is not only useful for detecting wildfires in otherwise remote areas, but also for understanding how large fires spread over time. This imagery uses satellite data from NASA MODIS Terra along with Suomi NPP VIIRS for global coverage of fire activity.\n\nSome of the global patterns that appear in the fire maps over time are the result of natural cycles of rainfall, dryness, and lightning. For example, naturally occurring fires are common in the boreal forests of Canada and grasslands in Australia in the summer. These are seen in opposite times of the year due to seasonal differences between the northern and southern hemispheres. In other parts of the world, the patterns are the result of human activity. For example, the intense burning in the heart of South America from August-October is a result of human-triggered fires, both intentional and accidental. Across Africa, a band of widespread agricultural burning sweeps north to south over the continent as the dry season progresses each year. Agricultural burning occurs in late winter and early spring each year across Southeast Asia as well.",

    "description": "Climate change may pose a significant threat to fisheries resources globally. This dataset shows percent change in global fisheries catch projected to occur by 2050 due to climate change. Comparison is made with fisheries catch levels reported in 2005. This study suggests that the distribution of major fish stocks will shift because of climate change as ocean temperature changes. Areas in orange experience reduced fisheries catch while areas in blue experience higher fisheries catch. The general pattern is a poleward shift in potential fisheries catches - that is fish distributions will shift to higher latitude areas (towards poles) and cooler waters as ocean temperatures increase. The study also predicts species extinction to occur in areas where species are most sensitive to temperature changes, resulting in reduced fisheries catch in these areas.\n\nFisheries in the tropics are projected to be among the most impacted by climate change, experiencing on average 40% reduction in catch by 2050. In contrast, some areas of the Arctic are expected to have higher fisheries catch in the future as sea ice melts and new habitat becomes available for lower-latitude species escaping warmer ocean conditions. The southern ocean in the Antarctic region is projected to have reduced fisheries catch because many species in this region are particularly sensitive to ocean temperature changes.\n\nData Source and Analysis: This dataset came from a 2010 peer-reviewed publication: Cheung et al. 2010. Analysis included 1066 species of harvested marine fishes and invertebrates, representing a wide range of taxonomic groups that account for 70% of the total United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported global fisheries landings from 2000-2004. Input parameters for the model include the species' maximum and minimum depth limits, northern and southern latitudinal range limits, an index of association with major habitat types and known occurrence boundaries. The study analyzed the effects of changes in sea surface and bottom temperature, salinity, sea ice, ocean current pattern and net primary production on future distribution and potential catch of these fish stocks. The fisheries catch data used to calculate the change in catch potential was reported as catch per unit area.",

    "description": "Species richness is a count of the number of different species in an ecological community, landscape or region. Species richness is one of several measurements used by scientists to help determine how biologically rich and diverse a given area is. This map shows the predicted global distribution of 1066 commercially harvested marine fish and invertebrates. Areas on the map with brighter colors (orange/yellow) highlight areas with greater number of different species (higher species richness), while cooler colors (purple) areas with lower number of species (lower species richness). The map shows the highest number of different species is concentrated along the coasts. These coastal areas are also where we find our largest marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs, mangroves and marshes, which provide food and shelter for economically, culturally, and ecologically important marine species. This stresses the importance of protecting critical habitat along our coasts for marine life and fisheries.\n\nA noticeably rich area on the map is the large area between Australia and Vietnam, which encompasses the Coral Triangle. The Coral Triangle is one of the world's most important marine hotspots for biodiversity and one of the most productive fishing areas in the world. Many nations in this region depend heavily on fisheries for their livelihood and economy, with fisheries accounting for over 90% of protein source in some countries. This dataset includes a triangle layer a presenter can turn on/off that highlights the Coral Triangle area.\n\nData Source and Analysis: This dataset came from a 2009 peer-reviewed publication: Cheung et al., 2009. The map was created by overlaying predicted species distribution maps of 1066 commercially exploited fisheries species on a 30' by 30' grid world map. These 1066 species represent a wide range of taxonomic groups and account for 70% of the total United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported global fisheries landings from 2000-2004.",

This worldwide buoy program was named Argo because the data from the Jason project and from this buoy project will be used together in computer models to help forecast ocean climate.\n\nIn order to measure temperature and salinity of the upper 2000m (over 6500ft) of the ocean, the Argo floats are designed to be neutrally buoyant at the \"parking depth\" which is typically 2000m. They drift along at this level for many days, recording data before an external bladder on the buoy causes it to slowly rise to the surface over a six-hour period. During the ascent, measurements are continuously taken. Once at the surface, satellites are used to determine the float's position and to receive the data transmitted by the instrument. After that has been completed, the bladder deflates and the float sinks back down to its parking depth. The whole cycle typically takes 10 days. This visualization shows the drifting movement across the oceans, but also their descent and ascent. The lighter floats are at the sea surface while the darker floats are below the sea surface. The dataset is referred to as \"waterfall\" because the data during the ascent of the float, when plotted, looks like a waterfall.",

    "description": "We've all felt the atmosphere's ability to move heat and moisture across our planet, but the atmosphere is only part of the story. Ocean currents are also essential in regulating the climates that make our planet so... livable. So how do these currents work, how do they affect us, and how might our actions be affecting them?\n\nFlow: Currents and Climate is a new film for the Science on a Sphere system, created by the Science Museum of Minnesota in partnership with the American Museum of Natural History, the Maryland Science Center, and the Institute for Learning Innovation. The movie is 8 minutes, 9 seconds long. Visit Forecast: Tropical Cyclone to download a second movie produced for the SOS Ocean-Atmosphere Partnership by the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nFlow introduces viewers to oceanic thermohaline circulation - the system of global ocean currents that cycle warm and cold water across the planet. This marine conveyor belt is a key mechanism in the complex exchange of energy between the oceans and the atmosphere, transferring heat from tropical regions to cooler high latitudes, and it plays a vital role in regulating Earth's climate.\n\nThe scale and complexity of ocean and atmosphere systems can make them seem remote and irrelevant to individual human beings. Flow combines global animations on the sphere with live-action actors to emphasize the impact distant ocean currents can have on our day-to-day lives. The film traces our knowledge of ocean-atmosphere circulation from Benjamin Franklin's early studies of the well-known Gulfstream Current, to the state of the art computer climate models currently being developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Contributed by the film's science advisors at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, colorful, high-resolution visualizations of worldwide ocean currents give viewers a glimpse of the actual sophisticated modeling tools scientists are using to study our oceans and atmosphere, and the effects global warming could have on a climate system humanity has relied upon for thousands of years.\n\nThe Maryland Science Center has developed a live SOS show for docents to engage audiences with the content of The Flow: Currents and Climate. Called the Ocean-Climate Connection , the show employs props and additional imagery and datasets.\n\nLength of dataset: 8:09",

The GLEaM simulation engine includes detailed population information and a multiscale mobility model integrating different layers of transportation networks ranging from the long range airline connections (accounting for more than 99% commercial traffic worldwide) to the short range daily commuting patterns (from the statistical analysis of census data from over countries in 6 different continents).\n\nEstimated Number of Cases of H1N1\n\nThis visualization illustrates the spread of the H1N1 influenza pandemic based on a detailed simulation performed using GLEaM that was able to predict the course of the pandemic several weeks in advance (BMC Medicine 7, 45 (2009)) and served as a way for researchers to evaluate the potential impact of several intervention measures. Starting from the first reported cases in La Puebla, Mexico on Feb 18, 2009, the course of the pandemic is followed as it spreads around the world. As passengers travel from an infected to an uninfected city, an edge is drawn connecting them so that we may follow the path taken by the virus. As new cases are generated from this passengers arrival, the city and its surrounding gradually changes color indicating the estimated number of cases, corresponding to the colorbar.\n\nFor more information on GLEaM and the GLEaMViz project, please visit www.gleamviz.org",

    "description": "Nowadays, we can anticipate where and when a tropical cyclone will hit land thanks to precision forecasts enabled by powerful computers and high-tech observational tools. But long ago, the most powerful storms in the world struck coastal dwellers by surprise. How did we learn to predict these tempests? Forecast: Tropical Cyclone, a new movie developed for Science On a Sphere (SOS)\u00ae by the American Museum of Natural History, chronicles the history and science of tropical cyclone prediction.\n\nForecast: Tropical Cyclone takes sphere-watchers on a journey through time and technology, beginning with early storm observations from Caribbean shores and the decks of schooners through the modern age of computer modeling. Along the way, dynamic narration, visualized data, and animation explain how people came to observe and understand the patterns of hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones\u2013collectively known as tropical cyclones. The movie also reveals the inner workings of these storms and deconstructs how computer models work to predict them.\n\nForecast: Tropical Cyclone was produced by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City as part of the SOS Ocean-Atmosphere Partnership, a collaboration between AMNH, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Maryland Science Center, and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. The movie is 8 minutes, 19 seconds long. Visit The Flow: Currents and Climate to download a second movie produced for the SOS Ocean-Atmosphere Partnership by the Science Museum of Minnesota.\n\nTo support the movie, AMNH has also prepared a description of datasets depicted as well as useful resources on tropical cyclones and computer modeling. Additionally, the Maryland Science Center has developed two live SOS shows for docents to engage audiences with the content of Forecast: Tropical Cyclone. The shows employ props and additional imagery and datasets. You will find the scripts and related resources at the following links:\n\nLength of dataset: 8:19",

    "title": "Forest Change (Extent, Gain, and Loss) - 2000 - 2014",
    "description": "This dataset shows annual tree cover extent,gain, and loss from the year 2001 to 2014, at 30 meter resolution, as colored layers that can be seen together or one at a time as individual layers that can be toggled on and off. Green is used to represent tree cover in 2000, red shows tree cover loss between 2001-2014, blue shows tree cover gain between 2001-2014, and purple is gain and loss together due to replanting after loss has occurred.\n\n\u201cTree cover\u201d is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. \u201cLoss\u201d indicates the removal or mortality of tree cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, \u201closs\u201d does not directly equate to deforestation.\n\nThe dataset is a collaboration between by Global Forest Watch partners at GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) lab at the University of Maryland, Google, USGS and NASA. The data were generated using Landsat imagery and algorithms to measure where tree cover patterns extend, or are lost, each year. When the algorithm sees the pattern of tree cover is missing or existing after one year, it places a pixel where this occurred. The tree cover extent data is used to measure against the loss or gain, thus giving us a sense of where the trees were to begin with or where they have been planted.\n\nTrees grow much faster in warmer, tropical regions than in colder, boreal regions. That is why there appears to be stronger overlap with loss and gain data (purple) in some parts of the world; trees are cut down, but they might grow back very quickly. This is also true of production forests and plantations; overlap in areas like Scandinavia and the southeast USA look particularly purple because these areas are logged then replanted with more timber trees, or in Indonesia areas are cleared then often replanted with oil palm plantations.\n\nYou can view of loss, gain, and extent as separate layers or one on top of each other. When the red loss and the blue gain layer are on top of one another or very close on a pixel-scale level, it looks like purple from afar. For visualizations purposes, we combined these layers into a separate purple layer.\n\nThe tree cover loss data is updated annually, but for visualization purposes, this was all aggregated into one layer. Therefore the yearly data from 2001-2014 is all mushed together into one \u201closs\u201d layer. However, the gain and extent data remain static, as they have only been updated once.\n\nClick to see the Global Forest Watch Interactive Map.",

    "title": "Fossil Fuel: CO2 Release - 2011-2012",
    "description": "This dataset shows the result of emitting carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning into the atmosphere over two years. A computer model of the atmosphere called TM5 was used to create this powerful visualization. TM5 simulates the movement of atmospheric gases globally, using winds and atmospheric mixing as derived from the global weather forecast. The model has been used for the main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), chemically active species such as ozone (O3), and various aerosols. Like CarbonTracker, a measurement and modeling system to keep track of carbon sources and sinks around the world, this dataset was developed by the Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory. Unlike CarbonTracker, this simulation does not use information from actual observations and instead visualizes the transport of fossil fuel emissions. Visualizations such as this dataset and CarbonTracker, aim to improve our understanding of atmospheric carbon and how various sources and sinks may respond to the changing climate, increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 (via the CO2 fertilization effect), and human management of global resources.\n\nThis dataset shows how atmospheric CO2 concentration changes due to daily emissions of CO2 from the burning of coal, oil, and natural gas (fossil fuels) over a two-year time period (2011-2012). Emissions come from the ODIAC (Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2) and are based on economic data. The video begins with a map of the world with no fossil fuel CO2. As time progresses the viewer watches the global accumulation of CO2 emissions from all fossil fuel sources over two years. In each frame all fossil CO2 from the surface to the top of the atmosphere is shown. Large emitters such as Eastern Asia, Western Europe, and the North East of North America stand out. By the end of 2012, the entire Northern Hemisphere is red, illustrating a total accumulation of over 10 ppm of CO2.\n\nEmissions produce a total global accumulation of 9.0 ppm of CO2 in the two years, which would be equal to a 2.3% increase of atmospheric CO2 (relative to a global average of 390.5 ppm during 2011 and 392.5 in 2012) from fossil fuel emissions every 2 years. Over a 10-year time period these emissions equate to 45 ppm of CO2 or an increase of 11.5%. If this amount could somehow be confined completely to a global layer of pure CO2 at the surface, it would be 36 cm, or 14\" thick everywhere. The actual observed atmospheric CO2 increase is about half that, or 5.0% per decade because approximately half of the emissions do not remain in the atmosphere, but are absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial plants. Unlike CarbonTracker, this dataset portrays purely how fossil fuel generated CO2 is transported through the atmosphere, and does not account for the redistribution of CO2 into the terrestrial biosphere and oceans.\n\nFind out more about NOAA CarbonTracker.

    "description": "A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal dimension that usually exceeds its topological dimension and may fall between the integers. Fractals are typically self-similar patterns, where self-similar means they are \"the same from near as from far\". Fractals may be exactly the same at every scale or they may be nearly the same at different scales. The definition of fractal goes beyond self-similarity per se to exclude trivial self-similarity and include the idea of a detailed pattern repeating itself.\n\nThe Mandelbrot set is a mathematical set of points whose boundary is a distinctive and easily recognizable two-dimensional fractal shape. The set is closely related to Circular Julia sets (which include similarly complex shapes), and is named after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who studied and popularized it.\n\nImages of the Mandelbrot set are made by taking numbers on the complex plane, calculating whether it tends to infinity when the formula is iterated on the number, then using the number as X and Y coordinates in the picture and coloring the pixel depending on whether it tends to infinity or not.

    "description": "In an era where change itself seems to be the subject holding people's attention, NASA proudly presents a spectacular new movie depicting a changing Earth. Called FROZEN, it showcases a major part of our home planet in ways never seen before.\n\nFROZEN features the global cryosphere, those places on Earth where the temperature doesn't generally rise above water's freezing point. As one of the most directly observable climate gauges, the changing cryosphere serves as a proxy for larger themes. The movie brings the Earth alive, projected onto spherical movie screens hanging in the center of darkened theaters. Turning in space, the sphere becomes a portal onto a virtual planet, complete with churning, swirling depictions of huge natural forces moving below.\n\nIce shows deep, persistent, global changes more readily than other kinds of geographic features. Where the world stays cold over time, liquid water freezes. Where the world persistently grows warm, ice in its many forms thaws. It's natural, therefore, to focus substantial attention on those parts of the Earth that historically depend on ice. Polar caps, high altitude glaciers, permafrost covered plains and many other cold regions play a vital role in global climate sustainability. As those regions and other cold places change, so changes the overall condition of the planet. As a proxy for climate change, changing ice opens a dialogue about a variety of subjects, from the importance of gathering long terms records about the Earth, to the techniques scientists use to study our home from space, to the day-to-day habits that individuals and communities around the world adopt in relation to their environment.\n\nFor more information, visit the Frozen website.\n\nLength of dataset: 12:25",

    "description": "The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was developed by NOAA to follow the transport and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. In HYSPLIT, the computation is composed of four components: transport by the mean wind, turbulent dispersion, scavenging and decay. A large number of pollutant particles, which by convention are called \"particles\" but are just computational \"points\" (particles or gases), are released at the source location and passively follow the wind.\n\nThe 2011 Tohuku East Japan earthquake and resulting tsunami caused a variety of failures at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant which resulted in radioactive emissions to the atmosphere. The earthquake occurred on March 11th at 14:26 Japan Standard Time (JST), the tsunami about one hour later at 15:41, and by 16:36 a nuclear emergency was reported. By the early morning hours of March 12th, radioactive emissions were occurring from the plant.\n\nIn this dataset, the simulation from NOAA's HYSPLIT model shows a continuous release of tracer particles from 12-31 March at a rate of 100 per hour representing the Cesium-137 emitted from Fukushima Daiichi. Each change in particle color represents a decrease in radioactivity by a factor of 10. Radioactivity decreases due to removal by rainfall and gravitational settling. Decay is not a factor for Cesium in this short duration simulation compared to its 30 year long-half life. The air concentration would be computed from the particle density so it is only partially related to the color scale. The released particles are followed through the end of April using meteorological data from the 1-degree resolution NOAA global analyses.",

    "description": "Ganymede is the Jupiter\u2019s largest moon. In fact, it is the largest moon in the solar system with a radius of 3280 miles, making it larger than both Mercury and Pluto and three-quarters the size of Mars. If Ganymede rotated around the Sun rather than around Jupiter, it would be classified as a planet. Ganymede has a very distinct surface with bright and dark regions. The surface includes mountains, valleys, craters and lava flows. The darker regions are more heavily littered with craters implying that those regions are older. The largest dark region is named Galileo Regio and is almost 2000 miles in diameter. The lighter regions display extensive series of troughs and ridges, thought to be a result of tectonic movement.\n\nA notable attribute of the craters on Ganymede is that they are not very deep and don\u2019t have mountains around the edges of them as can normally be seen around craters on other moons and planets. The reason for this is that the crust of Ganymede is relatively soft and over a geological time frame has flattened out the extreme elevation changes. Also, Ganymede is thought to have a fairly complex internal structure.",

    "description": "Earth is like a giant magnet with a North and South Pole. However, the magnetic North and South Pole are not aligned with the Geographic North and South Pole. The Geographic North Pole is defined by the latitude 90\u00b0 N and is the axis of the Earth's rotation. The Magnetic North Pole is where the Earth's magnetic field points vertically downward. The Earth creates its own magnetic field from the electric currents created in the liquid iron-nickel core.\n\nMagnetic north changes with time. In order to know where magnetic north is at different times in history, trackline data are collected every few seconds or minutes as a ship or aircraft travels, creating a connect-the-dot of data points, as depicted in this dataset.\n\nEach data point in the trackline data includes date, time, location, and other collected values, such as height/bathymetry, gravity, and magnetics. Over the last 50 years, thousands of marine and airborne trackline surveys have spanned the entirety of the globe, from pole to pole. NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS) for Geophysics in Boulder, Colorado formats, archives, and distributes these marine and airborne magnetic data contributed by many agencies and governments worldwide.\n\nGeomagnetic trackline datasets are necessary for the accurate modeling of the Earth's crustal magnetic field. The models NGDC produces from these data support safe and accurate ship and aircraft navigation, resource exploration, scientific research, satellite launches, and a variety of other uses. The geomagnetic models are also incorporated into smartphone compass apps so that users know where they are and what direction they are moving.",

    "title": "GFS Forecast Model: 500mb Heights and MSL Pressure Contours - Real-time",
    "description": "Meteorologists use many tools to predict the weather. They use past data such as temperature observations, real-time data such as radar and satellite images, and models that look into the future. Many different parameters are plotted using the numerical forecast models, which are generated using computers. The models consist of numerical equations which use current conditions as the inputs. The resulting outputs are forecasts for what is likely to happen in the future, based on those initial conditions. There are many different models that all attempt to do the same thing. The Global Forecast System model is used in this visualization. Six different outputs are available. One common factor in four of the visualizations is that 500mb heights are plotted. This is an important parameter to meteorologists because it is in the middle of the atmosphere. The 500mb height is the height at which the pressure is 500mb. When the 500mb height is low, there is low pressure at the surface, and when the 500mb height is high, there is high pressure at the surface. Patterns of troughs and ridges, which play a huge part in the weather, can also be seen clearly on the 500mb height plots. The 500mb height is also an indicator of atmospheric temperature.\n\nThe six outputs that are available for Science On a Sphere are the 500mb height image and contours, the 500mb height image with mean sea level pressure contours, the precipitable water image with 500mb height contours, the precipitable water image with mean sea level pressure contours, the six hour precipitation totals image with mean sea level pressure contours, and 500 mb height wind speed image with 500 mb height contours. The first one, the 500mb height image and contours, simply depicts the 500mb heights as both an image, with shading varying from red to blue, and contours. The red shading is for high heights and the blue shading is for low heights. The second dataset, the 500mb height image with mean sea level pressure contours, uses the same shading as the first. The difference between these two is that the contours are of the mean sea level pressure. The pressure has to be converted to mean sea level to adjust for places at high altitude. Adjusting the pressure allows meteorologists to pick out areas of high and low pressure. Generally areas with high pressure have clearer, sunnier weather than areas with low pressure, which tend to have cloudier, stormier weather. The third and fourth datasets both use the precipitable water forecast as the background image. The difference between the two is that the third dataset has 500mb heights contours while the fourth dataset has mean sea level pressure contours. Precipitable water is a forecast of how much water vapor there is in the atmosphere. When the water vapor concentration is high, rain is more likely. The red shading is for areas that are forecasted to be have low concentrations of water vapor and the blue shading is for areas that have high concentrations of water vapor and are more likely to receive rain. Notice that the water vapor concentrations tend to be highest to the right of troughs, which generally contain surface low pressure. Related to precipitable water is the six hour precipitation dataset. Rather than showing how much moisture is in the atmsophere, this dataset shows how much precipitation is forecasted to fall during a six hour period. The final dataset shows the 500mb height wind speeds. This dataset can be used to see the position and strength of the jet stream in meters per second.\n\nEach of these outputs is available in real-time. The real-time data are forecasts that predict out to 189 hours (7.5days) in future. Updated model runs are available every six hours. The data is also archived and is available starting February 8, 2006.",

The red shading is for high heights and the blue shading is for low heights. The second dataset, the 500mb height image with mean sea level pressure contours, uses the same shading as the first. The difference between these two is that the contours are of the mean sea level pressure. The pressure has to be converted to mean sea level to adjust for places at high altitude. Adjusting the pressure allows meteorologists to pick out areas of high and low pressure. Generally areas with high pressure have clearer, sunnier weather than areas with low pressure, which tend to have cloudier, stormier weather. The third and fourth datasets both use the precipitable water forecast as the background image. The difference between the two is that the third dataset has 500mb heights contours while the fourth dataset has mean sea level pressure contours. Precipitable water is a forecast of how much water vapor there is in the atmosphere. When the water vapor concentration is high, rain is more likely. The red shading is for areas that are forecasted to be have low concentrations of water vapor and the blue shading is for areas that have high concentrations of water vapor and are more likely to receive rain. Notice that the water vapor concentrations tend to be highest to the right of troughs, which generally contain surface low pressure. Related to precipitable water is the six hour precipitation dataset. Rather than showing how much moisture is in the atmsophere, this dataset shows how much precipitation is forecasted to fall during a six hour period. The final dataset shows the 500mb height wind speeds. This dataset can be used to see the position and strength of the jet stream in meters per second.\n\nEach of these outputs is available in real-time. The real-time data are forecasts that predict out to 189 hours (7.5days) in future. Updated model runs are available every six hours. The data is also archived and is available starting February 8, 2006.",

The GFS model includes cloud \"hydrometeor\" content in it output, and this data can be used to construct the clouds' visual appearance. The view is somewhat similar to what a weather satellite visible light image would show, if we could project this into the future. Bright clouds are thicker and often associated with stormy weather. This imagery is an output of the NOAA Global Forecast System weather model, which updates every six hours and provides weather predictions for 10 days out from the start time, in three-hour time increments. It directly shows whether your location on the Earth will be clear or cloudy during that time period.",

The energy of these rising air masses can be measured as the Convective Available Potential Energy, or CAPE. In other words, the greater amount of storm-forming convection, the higher the CAPE value. This imagery shows the predicted CAPE from the NOAA Global Forecast System weather model, which updates every six hours and provides weather predictions for 10 days (240 hours) out from the start time, in three-hour time increments. This data is useful for seeing, well in advance, areas where severe weather might arise, including thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes and even cyclones. Topical areas, due to the high temperatures and moisture of the surface air masses, tend to have the highest CAPE values, though high CAPE can be seen to seemingly flow into the mid-latitudes.",

Precipitable water is a forecast of how much water vapor there is in the atmosphere. When the water vapor concentration is high, rain is more likely. The red shading is for areas that are forecasted to be have low concentrations of water vapor and the blue shading is for areas that have high concentrations of water vapor and are more likely to receive rain. Notice that the water vapor concentrations tend to be highest to the right of troughs, which generally contain surface low pressure. Related to precipitable water is the six hour precipitation dataset. Rather than showing how much moisture is in the atmsophere, this dataset shows how much precipitation is forecasted to fall during a six hour period. The final dataset shows the 500mb height wind speeds. This dataset can be used to see the position and strength of the jet stream in meters per second.\n\nEach of these outputs is available in real-time. The real-time data are forecasts that predict out to 189 hours (7.5days) in future. Updated model runs are available every six hours. The data is also archived and is available starting February 8, 2006.",

They use past data such as temperature observations, real-time data such as radar and satellite images, and models that look into the future. Many different parameters are plotted using the numerical forecast models, which are generated using computers. The models consist of numerical equations which use current conditions as the inputs. The resulting outputs are forecasts for what is likely to happen in the future, based on those initial conditions. There are many different models that all attempt to do the same thing. The Global Forecast System model is used in this visualization. Six different outputs are available. One common factor in four of the visualizations is that 500mb heights are plotted. This is an important parameter to meteorologists because it is in the middle of the atmosphere. The 500mb height is the height at which the pressure is 500mb. When the 500mb height is low, there is low pressure at the surface, and when the 500mb height is high, there is high pressure at the surface. Patterns of troughs and ridges, which play a huge part in the weather, can also be seen clearly on the 500mb height plots. The 500mb height is also an indicator of atmospheric temperature.\n\nThe six outputs that are available for Science On a Sphere are the 500mb height image and contours, the 500mb height image with mean sea level pressure contours, the precipitable water image with 500mb height contours, the precipitable water image with mean sea level pressure contours, the six hour precipitation totals image with mean sea level pressure contours, and 500 mb height wind speed image with 500 mb height contours. The first one, the 500mb height image and contours, simply depicts the 500mb heights as both an image, with shading varying from red to blue, and contours. The red shading is for high heights and the blue shading is for low heights. The second dataset, the 500mb height image with mean sea level pressure contours, uses the same shading as the first. The difference between these two is that the contours are of the mean sea level pressure. The pressure has to be converted to mean sea level to adjust for places at high altitude. Adjusting the pressure allows meteorologists to pick out areas of high and low pressure. Generally areas with high pressure have clearer, sunnier weather than areas with low pressure, which tend to have cloudier, stormier weather. The third and fourth datasets both use the precipitable water forecast as the background image. The difference between the two is that the third dataset has 500mb heights contours while the fourth dataset has mean sea level pressure contours. Precipitable water is a forecast of how much water vapor there is in the atmosphere. When the water vapor concentration is high, rain is more likely.

All of these variables can be examined for features and patterns, and color helps in this process. Students of Earth is a production based on the GLOBE Earth Systems Poster Activity and modified for use on the Science on a Sphere. The activity guides the viewer through the process of understanding false-colored data, along with how to interpret images, time series, and even compare features from one dataset to another.\n\nTwo versions are available. A docent-led piece contains talking points, questions, and the appropriate playlists to run the activity as it is done in a classroom. This version, an autorun production, allows SOS installations without docents to run through the same activities. Both versions emphasize interaction between the viewer and the sphere. This piece is about seven minutes long..\n\nLength of autorun dataset: 6:59",

    "description": "One of the SOS Catalog's most popular dataset, real-time clouds, will be getting an upgrade! Most of the cloud coverage in the dataset is from geostationary satellites, and the satellites positioned over the U.S. and its territories are known as GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite). NOAA is launching the next generation of GOES satellites, called GOES-R Series, which will greatly improve weather observations.\n\nThe first satellite in the series, GOES-R, is scheduled for launch on November 19, 2016 at approximately 4:42pm EST. Once the satellite reaches geostationary orbit, it will be known as GOES-16. There will be four satellites in the series: GOES-R, GOES-S, GOES-T and GOES-U.\n\nGOES-R will provide continuous imagery and atmospheric measurements of Earth\u2019s Western Hemisphere, total lightning data, and space weather monitoring to provide critical atmospheric, hydrologic, oceanic, climatic, solar and space data.\n\nGOES-R is a game changer. Here is why!\n\nGOES-R's environmental data products will support short-term 1-2 day weather forecasts and severe storm watches and warnings, maritime forecasts, seasonal predictions, drought outlooks and space weather predictions.\n\nThe GOES-R series will maintain the two-satellite system implemented by the current GOES satellites. The operational GOES-R series satellites will be 75\u2070 W and 137\u2070 W and their operational lifetime extends through December 2036. For a history of GOES satellites, click here.",

    "description": "Before satellite tagging technology became feasible, it was thought that great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), spent most of their time close to the coasts feeding on seals and sea lions. With the advent of satellite tagging technology, many new behaviors of the great white shark have been discovered. By tagging a shark with a satellite transmitter, scientists are able to track the movement of the shark for extended periods. In 2001, a shark tagged off of the coast of California was tracked all the way to Hawaii, 3,800 km (2,280 miles) away. The shark spent the winter there before returning to waters closer to California. Several other sharks tagged off the coast of California also were tracked traveling great distances from California.\n\nMore recently, in November of 2003, about 30 great white sharks were tagged off of the coast of South Africa. Most of the sharks stayed near Africa, but one of these sharks, named Nicole, really surprised researchers when she traveled all the way to Australia. This journey of 11,100 km (6,897 miles) took the shark only ninety-nine days. This is considered to the farthest known distance traveled by a shark. The shark's tag detached when the shark was just south of Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia. Less than nine months later, scientists were truly surprised to find the same shark back in waters near South Africa. Using identification techniques with the dorsal fin, scientists were able to confirm that this shark was the same one that had traveled to Australia in the previous months. The total round trip from Africa to Australia and back is 20,000 km (12,400 miles), which is by far, the farthest known trip taken by a shark. This dataset follows Nicole from South Africa to Australia.",

    "description": "NASA launched the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) in 2002 to obtain high-resolution, global measurements of Earth's gravity field from space. Since that time, GRACE continues to reveal increasingly subtle changes in Earth's gravity field. These gravity variations reflect changes in the distribution of Earth's mass, including changes in groundwater and other forms of water stored on and in the land, changes in ice mass in Greenland and Antarctica, ocean mass changes, and even changes caused by large earthquakes. GRACE data are substantially improving our knowledge of important aspects of global change, including the climate consequences of a warming world.\n\nThese images show monthly changes in Earth's gravity field as measured by GRACE. The changes in gravity acceleration are expressed in cm of water equivalent, that is the thickness of a thin layer of water, covering the Earth's surface, that would have produced the corresponding change in gravity acceleration. As GRACE's twin satellites pass over features on Earth, the distance between the satellites changes in response to the mass of these features. Extremely sensitive instruments on GRACE can measure changes in the distance between the twin satellites to an accuracy of 1 micrometer (one-millionth of a meter), which is 20 to 100 times smaller than the width of a human hair. As GRACE orbits, it provides data for scientists to construct a new map of Earth's gravity field every month.\n\nGrace is a collaborative endeavor involving the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas, Austin; NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.; the German Space Agency and Germany's National Research Center for Geosciences, Potsdam.",

Can we socially evolve as quickly as we have transformed our Earth?\" *\n\nThese and other questions are explored by internationally-acclaimed artist Lars Jan/Early Morning Opera, immersive media artist/technologist Pablo N. Molina, and a team of scientists, engineers, and artists in the original live performance work HOLOSCENES.\n\nHOLOSCENES / Little Boxes is a 6-minute art/science film based on the original HOLOSCENES and specially adapted for Science On a Sphere\u00ae. The film features exquisite visuals of performers carrying out everyday behaviors in human-sized glass aquariums as water gradually rises and falls. As they are submerged in water, their demeanor invites us to reflect on how humans often respond to information and change - how we continue to act \u201cnormally\u201d in the face of what is occurring so clearly and quickly around us. The film inspires us to reflect on how we can take a step out of our habits and what we know - our daily rhythms within our \u201clittle boxes\u201d - and consider our interconnectedness and how our personal decisions affect a global scale.\n\nThe film fuses together the cognitive tools of science (facts, analysis, charts, and graphs) with the affective tools of art (images, metaphors, and storytelling) and creates an engaging visual experience that dives into the social, emotional side of climate change.\n\nHOLOSCENES / Little Boxes was made possible through a collaboration between EcoArts Connections and Science On a Sphere\u00ae (Boulder, CO) with funding received from the National Endowment for the Arts, 3P Biotechnologies, Inc., and the Boulder Arts Commission.\n\n*HOLOSCENES / Printed Matter Newsprint\n\nSuggestion: Consider incorporating this dataset into a presentation of other global change datasets to invite audiences to connect to the data on a different level.\n\nLength of Dataset: 5:48",

Featuring atmospheric scientist Tracy Twine from the University of Minnesota, the film explains the fundamentals of the greenhouse effect, the basic facts about changes in the carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere, and historical temperature variations. The show is built around a dataset showing global temperature anomalies from 1880 - 2012, carefully explaining what the dataset represents and what its implications are. Professor Twine then connects this global threat to her individual research on urban heat islands, demonstrating the connection between large-scale challenges and individual research efforts.\n\nHot Air is one in a series of four SOS films that use data visualizations and actual scientists to tell stories about the impacts of climate change. No other single natural factor affects Earth as much as humans now do. Separately, each film stands alone, focusing on a single area of human impact, and features a researcher working in this area. Together, the films tell a bigger story about the human-generated effects of global climate change.\n\nThis movie is available in English and Spanish.\n\nLength of dataset: 3:12",

The picture is actually a combination of footage from two cameras that are onboard the Hubble Telescope. The two cameras are the Advanced Camera for Surveys, ACS, and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-object Spectrometer (NICMOS). The exposure time for the picture was one million seconds, or 11.3 days. In order to achieve such a long exposure time, 800 separate exposures had to be taken over 400 Hubble orbits around the Earth. The image was taken from September 24, 2003 through January 16, 2004. The picture is of a very small piece of the galaxy in the Fornax constellation. In ground-based images of this space, it appears to be largely empty. It is only with the powerful camera aboard Hubble that distant galaxies become visible in this space. If astronomers were to take a picture like this one of the entire sky, rather than just one small piece, it would take 1 million years of exposure time.\n\nThe patch of sky that was photographed is only the size of 1/10 of the diameter of the whole moon. Astronomers say that this image is equivalent to looking through an 8 foot straw - the field of view is relatively narrow, but very deep. This new image reveals galaxies that have never before been visible, even with previous cameras aboard the Hubble Telescope. It is estimated that 10,000 galaxies are contained in the HUDF. There is a wide variety of galaxies visible in the image, some shaped like classic spirals and elliptical galaxies, and others that are very random. Astronomers say that the odd shaped galaxies are from a time when the universe was much more chaotic. This dataset starts with an all-sky view and highlights the small area where the HUDF was taken. Then some of the images from the HUDF are highlighted and displayed across the sphere.",

The optimal mean annual temperature of this identified niche is around 52 \u00b0F to 59 \u00b0F (\u223c11 \u00b0C to 15 \u00b0C).

This dataset identifies the current human climate niche, with land shaded to show which areas are more or less suitable for people, and then projects the future human climate niche in 2070 based on the climate projection scenario of RCP 8.5. Also included as an additional layer that can be turned on and off is a map that shows the areas where the mean annual temperature is greater than 84 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C). Currently, only 0.8% of the global land surface has a mean annual temperature greater than 84 \u00b0F, but in 2070 that is projected to cover 19% of the global land and impact an estimated 3.5 billion people.\n\nAccording to the researchers who developed this dataset, \u201cThe bottom line is that over the coming decades, the human climate niche is projected to move to higher latitudes in unprecedented ways. At the same time, populations are projected to expand predominantly at lower latitudes, amplifying the mismatch between the expected distribution of humans and the climate.\u201d The researchers estimate that roughly 30% of the projected global population would have to move if people were to live in the human climate niche as they do now. They further suggest that \u201ceach degree of temperature rise above the current baseline roughly corresponds to one billion humans left outside the temperature niche, absent migration\u201d for the socioeconomic SSP3 scenario.\n\nRead more about this dataset in the research article, Future of the Human Climate Niche.",

    "description": "The ocean has an impact on the lives of everyone on Earth, even those who don't live on the coasts. It has been estimated that one in every six jobs in the United States is marine-related and that 50% of all species on Earth are supported by the ocean. Because of this, it is important to protect and preserve the oceans. Humans however have been shown to have a negative impact on the oceans. A report issued in February 2008 found that 40% of the world's oceans are heavily impacted by human activities, such as overfishing and pollution. In all 17 different human activities were examined in the report, including fertilizer run-off, commercial shipping, and indirect activities such as changes in sea surface temperature, UV radiation, and ocean acidification.\n\nThis dataset is a map that was put together from the data compiled from the report, A Global Map of Human Impact on Marine Ecosystems, which was published in Science Magazine (see full text). In addition to finding that 40% of the world's oceans are heavily impacted by human activities, researchers also concluded that no area is unaffected by human influence. However, there are large areas that have relatively low human impact, especially near the poles. The areas where humans have had the worst impact include the East Cost of North America, North Sea, South and East China Seas, Caribbean Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Bering Sea and the western Pacific Ocean. Areas that are shaded red have a high human impact and blue areas have a very low human impact. The study also examined 20 marine ecosystems to determine the impact of the human influences. The ecosystems that are most threatened are coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves.",

    "description": "This dataset shows an accumulation of data over a 5-year period, between 2010 & 2015, based on data from the UN. Each of the world\u2019s countries are shaded to indicate their net migration, the difference between immigrants moving into and emigrants moving out of a country. Countries in shades of orange saw a net increase in migration, while those countries shaded in purple saw a net decrease.\n\nOver the 5-year period depicted, countries with the highest levels of net migration included Germany, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Canada, and Australia. The United States saw the highest level with a total of 4.5 million. Countries with the lowest levels of net migration (a net decrease) included Spain, China, Sudan, India, and Pakistan. Syria had the largest decrease in net migration at -4.1 million.\n\nMigration patterns can be influenced by many factors. Modern modes of travel have made it easier than ever for people to move throughout the world. Many international migrants travel in search of new employment and opportunities. Others are forced to move due to regional instability, violence, and poverty, searching for a higher quality of life for their families. These movements impact countries all over the world in a variety of ways, both in those seeing a net influx of migrants and in those seeing a net decrease.\n\nIn 2017, it is estimated that there were 258 million international migrants worldwide, representing an increase of over 80 million people when compared to data from 2000. When supported by appropriate policies, there are several benefits for countries seeing high rates of net migration. Labour gaps are filled, jobs are created by new entrepreneurs, tax and social security revenues increase, and rich cultural diversity is introduced to communities within host countries.",

    "description": "On January 15th 2022, an underwater volcano erupted in the South Pacific Ocean blasting steam, ash, and sulfur dioxide to record heights. The explosive eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai created a sonic boom heard as far north as Alaska. It also triggered a tsunami that destroyed homes on nearby islands before crossing the ocean to the coasts of Japan and North and South America. The Hunga-Tonga eruption was so powerful that it sent a rare pressure wave rippling around the world. NOAA\u2019s GOES-17 and Japan\u2019s Himiwari-8 geostationary satellites were perfectly positioned to observe and document the historic event. A team of scientists used the satellite data to determine that the volcanic plume soared through the troposphere and stratosphere into the mesosphere to a height of 36 miles, or 58 kilometers high. That\u2019s two and a half times higher than any thunderstorm ever observed. Even satellites in the ionosphere \u2013 which borders on the edge of space \u2013 detected unusual electric currents and hurricane-speed winds associated with this intense volcanic event. The atmospheric pressure wave generated by the Hunga-Tonga eruption circled Earth for several days. This model animation shows the shock wave pattern as it propagated around the planet. Satellite sensors detected the travelling pressure wave via temperature changes in mid-level atmospheric water vapor imagery, seen in this animation that stitches data together from multiple geostationary satellites. The reverberating shock waves were unlike anything seen in the modern satellite era. They spread outward in concentric rings from the South Pacific volcano and crisscrossed the globe multiple times. Pressure sensors on the ground also captured the passage of the wave. Similar to satellites, surface observing systems measured changes in pressure for several days as successive waves rippled and crossed in their journey around the planet. From below the surface of the sea to the edge of space and every layer of the atmosphere in-between; the vast amounts of data collected from the 2022 Hunga-Tonga volcano eruption ensure that scientists will be studying this historic event for years to come.",

In a four-day period, many areas of eastern Texas received over 40 inches of rain as the system meandered along the gulf coast causing catastrophic flooding. With a record of 51.88 inches, Harvey is the wettest tropical hurricane on record in the contiguous U.S. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, displaces more than 30,000 people, and prompted more than 17,000 rescues.\n\nThe eighth named storm and third hurricane in a very prolific hurricane season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles, reaching tropical storm status on the 17th of August and intensified to a category 4 hurricane by August 26th when it made landfall near Rockport, Texas. Afterwards, although the storm weakened, rapidly, Harvey stalled near the coastline of the state, dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state. The third and final landfall of the storm came in Louisiana on August 29th before it drifted inland and dissipated.\n\nHarvey caused at least 83 confirmed deaths. Preliminary estimates for economic losses are between 70 and 200 billion dollars.",

All ten of the Atlantic hurricanes occurred in a row, the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era. In addition, it is by far the costliest season on record, with a preliminary total of over $368.66 billion (USD) in damages, which is more than double the cost of 2005\u2019s total, and nearly all of which was due to three of the season's major hurricanes \u2014 Harvey, Irma, and Maria. All three occurred within one month in August - September, sending disaster aide efforts reeling and calling on volunteers for help.\n\nHurricane Maria, is regarded as the worst natural disaster on record in Dominica and Puerto Rico, while also being the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017, it was a true catastrophe for the people and infrastructure for several Caribbean islands. For example, Maria effectively destroyed Puerto Rico's power grid. Three months after the hurricane, 45% of Puerto Ricans were still without power. It followed directly behind Hurricane Irma , the strongest tropical storm ever observed in terms of wind speed with 36 hours of sustained category 5 185 mph winds, struck the Florida Keys and Florida's Gulf Coast.",

Intensifying into a Hurricane, Sandy made landfall first near Kingston, Jamaica on October 24th and after reaching Category 2 hurricane status struck Cuba the next day. After killing 70 people in Haiti, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Bahamas, Hurricane Sandy pointed north and moved towards the East Coast of the United States. Sandy eventually moved ashore near Atlantic City, New Jersey and New York City on October 29th as a post-tropical cyclone with hurricane force winds. All said and done Superstorm Sandy (as it was termed after it joined a cold-core low pressure system moving eastward at the same time) affected an astounding total of 25 U.S. states. Most of the damage occurred in the Mid-Atlantic States. Sandy even caused the formation of an intense snowstorm in the high altitude regions of West Virginia.\n\nThe Supreme Court, New York City Stock Exchange, Amtrak, and nearly all airports and railways near the East Coast were closed for two days; nearly 20,000 flights were canceled in all. The New York City Subway was still trying to repair the damage six weeks later. Total damage in the U.S. is estimated at over $63 billion.\n\nIR Satellite images from GOES show clouds by measuring the infrared radiation emitted, which is directly proportional to the temperature.

The season featured 15 tropical storms, 9 of which became hurricanes, and 6 of those were classified as major hurricanes. This over-active hurricane season tallied up a bill of $42 billion in damages, which at the time was record high. Florida took the brunt of the damage with 4 major hurricanes making landfall in the state. Two of the hurricanes, Frances and Jeanne, landed in almost the same location on the east coast of Florida only 3 weeks apart. It is estimated that one in every five homes in Florida was damaged in the 2004 hurricane season.\n\nThis data set was created using infrared satellites, which measure emitted heat. Where there are clouds, the satellites measure the heat emitted by the cloud rather than the ground below it. Because clouds are so much colder than the ground, they are easy to detect on IR satellite images. Areas that show up in the bright colors are extremely cold and the gray shades are areas that are warmer. The higher the cloud, the colder the cloud top will be and so it shows up vividly on the IR satellite image. Hurricanes and tropical storms are well developed weather systems and therefore have high clouds that are easy to detect in the IR satellite images.",

    "description": "\"This hurricane season shattered records that have stood for decades - most named storms, most hurricanes and most category five storms. Arguably, it was the most devastating hurricane season the country has experienced in modern times,\" said retired Navy Vice Adm. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Jr., Ph.D., undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere and NOAA administrator.\n\nWith 28 named storms, 15 hurricanes, seven major hurricanes, and four category 5 hurricanes, the 2005 hurricane season certainly blew the records away. It was also the first season in which four major hurricanes hit the U.S.. The season started early and ended late with two tropical storms in June (which hadn\u2019t happened since 1986) and three tropical storms in November with one that formed in December and dissipated in January. The season also included the most rapid intensification of a hurricane in 24 hours in the Atlantic Ocean, a record held by Wilma. The third and fourth most intense hurricanes ever recorded in the Atlantic basin were Rita and Wilma.\n\nEven with all these records, the 2005 hurricane season will arguably be most remembered for Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Mississippi, Louisiana and in particular, New Orleans. Over 1600 people died during the storm and an estimated cost for all the damage, $75 billion, makes Katrina the costliest hurricane ever.\n\nThis dataset is a gray-scale infrared satellite image available from June 1, 2005 through January 3, 2006. IR satellites measure emitted heated. Where there are clouds, the satellites measure the heat emitted by the clouds rather than the ground below it. Because clouds are so much colder than the ground, they are easy to detect on IR satellite images. The brightest white clouds are the highest ones, indicating that they have powerful storms below.",

    "description": "\"It was an extremely devastating and destructive storm, hopefully one that people will only see once in their lifetime,\" National Weather Service meteorologist, Joe Pollina, said of Hurricane Sandy. The 2012 Atlantic Hurricane season was tied with 1887, 1995, 2010 and 2011 as the third most active year in recorded history, producing nineteen tropical cyclones and named storms, ten hurricanes and two major hurricanes. Annual Atlantic hurricane predictions by NOAA and Colorado State University fell short of the actual numbers despite raising their numbers after a record active start to the season, which began on June 1st and ended on November 30th. The Eastern Pacific season was moderately active. This dataset names all the Atlantic and Pacific named tropical storms and hurricanes in 2012 from the Linear IR Satellite data recorded by geostationary satellites.\n\nThe satellites that collect these data are geostationary, meaning that they rotate at the same rate as the Earth so that the satellites are over the same spot on Earth all the time. This allows them to collect a continuous stream of data for one location so that \"movies\" of the data can be made. Over the United States there are two such satellites, the GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) - East and GOES-West. There are many such satellites worldwide. This dataset is a composite of GOES, Meteosat, and MTSAT satellite data. Meteosat and MTSAT are similar to GOES, but operated by other countries. This real-time dataset is shaded on a gray scale, meaning that the lowest clouds are a very light gray and the highest clouds are bright white. The \"Blue Marble\" is the background image for this dataset.\n\nWell over half of the tropical cyclones that developed in the 2012 season made landfall or directly impacted land. Hurricane Sandy and Isaac were the deadliest and most destructive. Hurricane Isaac formed on August 21st, developed an eye on August 25th before making landfall in Haiti, then Cuba, and finally at the mouth of the Mississippi River in the Gulf of America as a category 1 hurricane on August 28th, and postponed the Republican National Convention. Hurricane Sandy formed in the Caribbean Sea on October 22nd and made landfall in Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas before it crashed into New Jersey and New York affecting 24 U.S. states. Sandy finally dissipated on October 30th, causing at least $65.6 billion in damage and 253 deaths, making it the second most costly hurricane in recorded history. For more a more detailed live program highlighting only Hurricane Sandy go to Observing Hurricane Sandy like a Meteorologist.\n\nFor more information on the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season named storms and those that made hurricane status including Chris, Ernesto, Gordon, Isaac, Kirk, Leslie, Michael, Nadine, Rafael, and Sandy visit National Hurricane Center - NOAA. For more information on the 2012 Eastern Pacific hurricane season named storms and those that made hurricane status including Bud, Carlotta, Daniel, Emilia, Fabio, Gilma, Ileana, Lane, Miriam, and Paul visit National Hurricane Center - NOAA.",

All ten of the Atlantic hurricanes occurred in a row, the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes in the satellite era. In addition, it is by far the costliest season on record, with a preliminary total of over $368.66 billion (USD) in damages, which is more than double the cost of 2005\u2019s total, and nearly all of which was due to three of the season's major hurricanes \u2014 Harvey, Irma, and Maria. All three occurred within one month in August - September, sending disaster aide efforts reeling and calling on volunteers for help.\n\nThis dataset names both atlantic and pacific hurricanes in 2017 in the labels of the dataset. The record-breaking hurricanes in 2017 included Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Ophelia. Hurricane Harvey, was an extremely destructive Atlantic hurricane which became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. since Wilma in 2005. In a four-day period, many areas of eastern Texas received over 40 inches of rain as the system meandered along the gulf coast causing catastrophic flooding. With a record of 51.88 inches, Harvey is the wettest tropical hurricane on record in the contiguous U.S. The resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes, displaced more than 30,000 people, and prompted more than 17,000 rescues.\n\nHurricane Irma , the strongest tropical storm ever observed in terms of wind speed with 36 hours of sustained category 5 185 mph winds, struck the Florida Keys and Florida's Gulf Coast in early September. The storm right behind it, Hurricane Maria, was the most intense tropical cyclone to strike the U.S. territories in recorded history. Maria caused so much damage in Puerto Rico, many Puerto Ricans were still without power months later.\n\nHurricane Ophelia became the easternmost category 3 storm in recorded history and dissipated into an extra-tropical cyclone that wreaked windy havoc on Ireland and Great Britain.",

    "description": "The 2020 hurricane season is one for the record books. While the Atlantic hurricane season officially starts on June 1 and runs through November 30, hurricanes can form at any time. The first storm of the 2020 season, Tropical Storm Arthur, formed on May 16, 2020 and was followed by Tropical Storm Bertha on May 27, 2020. The busy season continued and the predetermined list of 21 storm names was used up by September 18, 2020 with Tropical Storm Wilfred. From there, nine more storms formed that were given Greek alphabet letters for names. This has only happened once before, in 2005. In total, there were 30 named storms, 10 of which formed in a very busy September. Of those 30 storms, 13 of them turned into hurricanes and 6 of those were major hurricanes (category 3 or higher). For comparison, a typical season has six hurricanes with three of them being major hurricanes. 12 of the storms hit the U.S. coastline, which was also a record. The previous record was 9 landfalls back in 1916.\n\n\u201cAs we correctly predicted, an interrelated set of atmospheric and oceanic conditions linked to the warm AMO (Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation) were again present this year. These included warmer-than-average Atlantic sea surface temperatures and a stronger west African monsoon, along with much weaker vertical wind shear and wind patterns coming off of Africa that were more favorable for storm development. These conditions, combined with La Nina, helped make this record-breaking, extremely active hurricane season possible,\u201d said Gerry Bell, Ph.D, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center. This was the 5th consecutive above-normal hurricane season. This dataset, created from an archive of the Clouds - Real-time dataset, runs from May 1, 2020 through November 30, 2020 and shows the name and location of each of the storms through the season.",

    "description": "Tracking historical hurricanes is an important way for hurricane researchers to learn about the paths of future hurricanes. Because of this, records of hurricane paths are archived and studied. Not all hurricanes follow the same path, but there are certainly noticeable trends for hurricane paths. Many computer models that have been created to predict hurricane paths include the historical data in their models.\n\nThis dataset shows the paths of all tropical cyclones from 1950 through 2020. Each line is a tropical cyclone, whether a tropical depression or tropical storm (blue, cyan) or hurricane (yellow to red). The maximum sustained wind speed, with cool colors for slower speeds and warm colors for faster speeds, are indicated by the colorbar. When mapped like this, definite patterns in cyclone paths are clear to see. For example, you can see that cyclones typically start near the equator and move away from it toward the poles and they don't cross the equator.\n\nWant to learn about a specific hurricane that affected you or someone you know? Check out this Historical Hurricanes site.\n\nPaper Globe Cutouts are available for this dataset!",

    "title": "Iapetus: Saturn's Moon",
    "description": "Iapetus has two distinctly different sides. The leading hemisphere is dark with an albedo (reflectivity) of .04, almost the same as asphalt. In contrast, the trailing side is bright with an albedo of .6, almost the same as snow. The dark region is called the Cassini Regio and the bright region is Roncevaux Terra. Much has been learned about the difference in coloration on Iapetus in recent years. One long-standing theory is that the moon has accumulated dust from other moons around Saturn as it travels along its orbit. Thanks to new images from Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem, scientists have a new theory. \"Close-up ISS images provide a clue, showing evidence for thermal segregation, in which water ice has migrated locally from sunward-facing and therefore warmer areas, to nearby poleward-facing and therefore colder areas, darkening and warming the former and brightening and cooling the latter.\" Southwest Research Institute News The edge between the dark and light region is not a sharp edge, as originally thought, but soft, with some craters lined with the dark material on one side but not the other. The dark material is superimposed over the topography, which leads scientists to believe that the coating is relatively young.\n\nIapetus touts not only a unique coloration, but also a ridge that follows almost exactly along the equator of the moon in the Cassini Regio. This ridge, discovered on December 31, 2004, is 8 miles higher than the surrounding land and runs over 800 miles. Reasons for the existence of this ridge are unknown, but many varying theories do exist. Iapetus is also a heavily cratered moon containing three craters with diameters greater than 200 miles. The largest of these has a diameter of over 300 miles wide with cliffs that drop over 9 miles.",

Since then, the space station has been continuously inhabited by at least 2 people. The station is currently designed to house 3 crew members. The International Space Station is a cooperative space research facility being constructed cooperatively by many nations. Several space organizations had planned their own space stations and the groups decided to merge and work together. The original space station was a combination of NASA's Space Station Freedom, Russia's Mir-2, and the European Space Agency's Columbus. The project now involves NASA, the Russian Space agency, RKA; the European Space Agency, ESA; the Japanese Space agency, JAXA; and the Canadian Space agency, CSA.\n\nThe International Space Station is scheduled to be completed in 2010 and then is to remain operational through 2016. Currently it is the largest space station ever, and it is only expected to expand. Once the assembly is complete, the station will have 35,000 cubic feet (1000 cubic meters) of pressurized area. It is positioned at an altitude of 213 miles (344 km) above the Earth. At this height, it travels an astonishing 17,224.35 miles per hour. It is able to circle the entire globe in just 91.2 minutes, which means that in just one day it makes 15.7 orbits around the Earth. Because of this, the astronauts onboard experience almost 16 sunrises and sunsets each day. To counter this, they hang black curtains over the windows to simulate night while they try to sleep. This dataset shows the track that the International Space Station would make after circling the Earth three times.",

    "description": "On March 11, 2011 at 2:45 local time, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake occurred 81 miles (130 km) off the east coast of Sendai, Japan, triggering a massive tsunami. It is estimated that the initial tsunami wave took 10 to 30 minutes to make its first landfall. Forecasted wave heights were up to 33 ft (10 m) and there were many reports of tsunami waves three stories high in parts of Japan. Across the Pacific Ocean, many countries issued evacuations along the coasts because of the predicted tsunami waves.\n\nThere are several datasets related to this event. The first is a model run of predicted tsunami wave heights from the Center for Tsunami Research at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. It shows the predicted wave heights of the tsunami as it travels across the Pacific basin. The largest wave heights are near the earthquake epicenter, off Japan. The wave decreases in height as it travels across the deep Pacific but grows taller as it encounters shallow waters near coastal areas. In general, the energy of the wave decreases with distance, causing the maximum height of the waves at the coasts to decrease. This explains why coastal Hawaii does not see the heights that were encountered in coastal Japan. Out in the open ocean, areas of low wave height correspond to deeper areas in the ocean.\n\nTo show the earthquake activity, a snapshot of the Real-Time Earthquake dataset has been archived, Japan Earthquake . This loop, which is composed of hourly images, starts on February 19, 2011 and runs through March 24, 2011. Increased activity near Japan can be seen in the days before March 11. After the event, hundreds of powerful aftershocks, occurred for days. Over thirty of the aftershocks had a magnitude of greater than 6. This dataset merges the above earthquake activity with the predicted tsunami wave heights.",

    "title": "Japan Earthquake - March 2011",
    "description": "On March 11, 2011 at 2:45 local time, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake occurred 81 miles (130 km) off the east coast of Sendai, Japan, triggering a massive tsunami. It is estimated that the initial tsunami wave took 10 to 30 minutes to make its first landfall. Forecasted wave heights were up to 33 ft (10 m) and there were many reports of tsunami waves three stories high in parts of Japan. Across the Pacific Ocean, many countries issued evacuations along the coasts because of the predicted tsunami waves.\n\nThere are several datasets related to this event. The first is a model run of predicted tsunami wave heights from the Center for Tsunami Research at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. It shows the predicted wave heights of the tsunami as it travels across the Pacific basin. The largest wave heights are near the earthquake epicenter, off Japan. The wave decreases in height as it travels across the deep Pacific but grows taller as it encounters shallow waters near coastal areas. In general, the energy of the wave decreases with distance, causing the maximum height of the waves at the coasts to decrease. This explains why coastal Hawaii does not see the heights that were encountered in coastal Japan. Out in the open ocean, areas of low wave height correspond to deeper areas in the ocean.\n\nTo show the earthquake activity, a snapshot of the Real-Time Earthquake dataset has been archived. This loop, which is composed of hourly images, starts on February 19, 2011 and runs through March 24, 2011. Increased activity near Japan can be seen in the days before March 11. After the event, hundreds of powerful aftershocks, occurred for days. Over thirty of the aftershocks had a magnitude of greater than 6. In addition, another dataset, Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Wave Heights Merged was created by merging the earthquake activity with the predicted tsunami wave heights.",

    "description": "On March 11, 2011 at 2:45 p.m. local time, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake occurred 81 miles (130 km) off the east coast of Sendai, Honshu, Japan, triggering a massive tsunami. A tsunami is a series of ocean waves generated by sudden displacements in the sea floor, landslides, or volcanic activity. In the deep ocean, the tsunami wave may only be a few inches high. The tsunami wave may come gently ashore or may increase in height to become a fast moving wall of turbulent water several meters high. Forecasted wave heights in Japan were up to 66 ft (20 m) and there were many reports of tsunami waves three stories high in parts of Japan. Across the Pacific Ocean, many countries issued evacuations along the coasts because of the predicted tsunami waves. Propagation of the tsunami was computed with the NOAA forecast method using the MOST (Method of Splitting Tsunami) model with the tsunami source inferred from DART. Approximately 25 minutes after the earthquake, the tsunami was first recorded by one of the DART buoys.\n\nThe NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, located at NOAA PMEL in Seattle, WA runs the MOST model and produced this dataset. The main objective of the forecast model is to provide an estimate of wave arrival time, wave height and inundation area immediately after a tsunami event. Tsunami forecast models are run in real time while a tsunami is propagating in the open ocean, consequently they are designed to perform under very stringent time limitations. In addition to the forecasted 66 ft wave heights, the model also shows over 130 ft (40 m) of runup, which is the highest topographic elevation that the tsunami reaches. Observations have confirmed the runup height of 130 ft in parts of Japan. As the tsunami radiated out from Japan, it encountered the complex topography and bathymetry of sea floor, causing the wave to scatter and reflect. After 8 hours, the tsunami hit Hawaii and after 9.5 hours, the tsunami made landfall on the west coast of the United States. At the 16 hour mark, the tsunami wave entered the Indian Ocean and at the 22 hour mark, the wave had propagated throughout the entire Pacific Ocean and was an incredibly complex wave due to the varied topography and bathymetry of the sea floor. The yellow dots mark the locations of the DART buoys. The final frames of this dataset show the maximum wave amplitude and the arrival time of the tsunami wave.\n\nA second version of this dataset combines the Wave Propagation model with the other Japan Tsunami datasets that are available here. It starts by showing the earthquake activity leading up to the tsunami, then shows the tsunami wave propagation combined with earthquake activity and then ends with a map of maximum wave heights.",

    "description": "The fifth planet in the solar system, Jupiter is the first of the gas planets. It is the largest planet in the solar system with an impressive radius of 44,423 miles, more than 11 times that of Earth, and about one-tenth that of the sun. Because Jupiter is a gas planet, it does not have a solid surface, the gases simply become denser closer to the center, eventually turning into a liquid. Because this planet is not a solid, it easily distorts. In fact, Jupiter, which has the fastest rotation rate in the solar system, bulges at the equator and flattens at the poles due to its rapid rotation. Jupiter\u2019s composition is estimated to be 90% hydrogen and 10% helium with a couple of other trace gases as well. What can be seen from space are the ammonia clouds that surround the planet. The visible bands of color are the result of very high velocity winds that flow in opposite directions in adjacent bands. Within these bands are storms that have raged on for years. The most notable is the Great Red Spot, a storm that has been observed for 300 years. Three Earth\u2019s could easily fit into the Great Red Spot.\n\nJupiter has been described as its own little solar system because of the vast number of moons orbiting the planet. There are 63 moons around Jupiter, the most of any planet in the solar system. Four in particular, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, are planet sized. In 2003 alone, 23 new moons were discovered. Reasons for this incredible number of moons include the strong gravitational force of the planet at 20.87 m/s2, more than double the gravitational force on Earth, and also the large magnetic field of the planet, which extends into Saturn\u2019s orbit. Like Saturn, Jupiter also has rings, though they are only visible when backlit by the sun and believed to be comprised of dust kicked up from meteor collisions with the four biggest moons.\n\nSeveral new Jupiter datasets have come from both the Hubble Space Telescope and the New Horizons spacecraft. The Hubble Space Telescope datasets include this dataset which is a sequence of images that show the different layers of Jupiter's atmosphere by varying the spectrum, surface pictures from February and March of 2007 that show the Great Red Spot and the Red Spot Junior, and a view of Jupiter after it was hit by a comet. The New Horizons spacecraft was launched in January of 2006 with the goal of studying Pluto in 2015. On its way to Pluto, New Horizons has provided pictures of other planets as well. The black and white animation of Jupiter that is available for SOS is made of images from New Horizons spacecraft that have been overlaid on a Hubble Space Telescope image from 2007.",

There are 63 moons around Jupiter, the most of any planet in the solar system. Four in particular, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, are planet sized. In 2003 alone, 23 new moons were discovered. Reasons for this incredible number of moons include the strong gravitational force of the planet at 20.87 m/s2, more than double the gravitational force on Earth, and also the large magnetic field of the planet, which extends into Saturn\u2019s orbit. Like Saturn, Jupiter also has rings, though they are only visible when backlit by the sun and believed to be comprised of dust kicked up from meteor collisions with the four biggest moons.\n\nSeveral new Jupiter datasets have come from both the Hubble Space Telescope and the New Horizons spacecraft. The Hubble Space Telescope datasets include this dataset which shows surface pictures from February and another from March of 2007 that show the Great Red Spot and the Red Spot Junior, a sequence of images that show the different layers of Jupiter's atmosphere by varying the spectrum (HST sequence), and a view of Jupiter after it was hit by a comet. The New Horizons spacecraft was launched in January of 2006 with the goal of studying Pluto in 2015. On its way to Pluto, New Horizons has provided pictures of other planets as well. The black and white animation of Jupiter that is available for SOS is made of images from New Horizons spacecraft that have been overlaid on a Hubble Space Telescope image from 2007.",

    "description": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification is a widely used vegetation-based empirical climate classification system developed by German botanist-climatologist Wladimir K\u00f6ppen. It's based on the idea that climate is best defined by native vegetation. The formulas used in the classification correspond to those of the vegetation zones (biomes) that were being mapped for the first time in the late 19th century. It was first published in 1884 and was revised until 1940 with collaboration by German climatologist Rudolf Geiger.\n\nThis particular version of K\u00f6ppen-Geiger shows the changes in the climate regions and biomes over time (from 1901 - 2100) using observations for 1901 - 2000 and the A1F1 IPCC climate scenario for 2001 - 2100. A1F1 is the worst case scenario future projection for climate change modeling. You can find out more information on how this was made by visiting World Maps of K\u00f6ppen-Geiger Climate Classisification website.\n\nK\u00f6ppen-Geiger's classification is based on a subdivision of terrestrial climates into five major types, which are represented by the capital letters A - E. Each of these except for B is defined by temperature criteria. Type B designates climates in which the controlling factor on vegetation is dryness. The second subdivision (second letter) clarifies further the type of climate based on precipitation and temperature. Although K\u00f6ppen-Geiger's classification did not account for the uniqueness of highland climate regions, the highland climate category, or H climate, is sometimes added to modified maps to cover the elevations higher than 1,500 meters.\n\nThe second legend for this dataset, describing the climate letter codes, is included in the dataset as a layer called Letter Code Legend. You can toggle the legend on as needed. You will find it by tapping on the \"Layers\" tab in the iOS SOS Remote App 4.0+.",

    "description": "Rather than plotting sea surface temperatures, sea surface temperature anomalies have been plotted here to show the dramatic departures from normal that are associated with El Nino and La Nina from 1980 - 1999. El Nino is the warming of the Pacific Ocean off of the western coast of South America near Ecuador and Peru. It is called El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, referring to the Christ child because the phenomena usually occurs near Christmas time. The opposite of El Nino is La Nina, or little girl in Spanish, which is a cooling of the Pacific Ocean. The red shading signifies a warming of the ocean by 5-10\u00b0F, the green shading is normal and the blue shading is a cooling of the ocean by 5-10\u00b0F.\n\nIn strong El Nino years, a prominent red band indicating warmer water extends out into the Pacific Ocean. Observed El Nino years include 1982-1983, 1986-1987, 1991-1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997-1998. The series of El Nino\u2019s in the early 1990\u2019s was unusual because they were spaced so close together, though they were all relatively weak. The most notable El Nino years include 1982-1983, 1986-1987 and 1997-1998. In fact, the 1997-1998 El Nino was so strong that it started to gain national attention. The effects of a strong El Nino include a wetter than normal season in most of the United States, though the Pacific Northwest states tend to be drier. An El Nino affects the weather worldwide. Indonesia and the Philippines, for example, are drier than normal during El Nino and have increased risk of forest fires while East Africa experiences much wetter conditions from March through May. La Nina has the opposite effect as El Nino, causing the United States to be drier than normal. Samples of a strong El Nino and La Nina occurrence are available as additional datasets. In these datasets, the land is true color shaded and a mask has been applied to highlight only the region off of South America.",

This data is extensively used for modeling weather and climate, along with applications such as agriculture.\n\nThe data plots shown here are generated by averaging all of the data collected by the NOAA AMSU and DMSP SSM/I microwave sensors from seven different polar-orbiting satellites over a 24 hour period.

It's therefore only fitting - and certainly about time - that the fifth planet receive its proper cinematic due, set naturally on the most appropriate cinematic platform. With the movie LARGEST, Jupiter comes to Science On a Sphere.\n\nLARGEST examines the gas giant like a work of art, like a destination of celestial wonder. Starting with the basics, the movie examines the gross anatomy of the immense planet. From swirling winds to astounding rotational velocity to unimaginable size, Jupiter demands nothing less than a list of superlatives. But where general description sets the stage, LARGEST parts the curtains on humanity's experience with the fifth planet. The movie takes us on a journey to this immense sphere via dramatic fly-bys with some of the most astounding robotic probes ever designed. Then, with NASA instruments trained on the striped behemoth, the drama really begins. To learn more about LARGEST, visit the film's website at:\n\nLength of dataset: 8:00",

    "description": "Light pollution in urban centers creates a sky glow that can blot out the stars. The brighter the area in this map the harder it is to see stars and constellations in the night sky.\n\nThe Milky Way, the brilliant river of stars that has dominated the night sky and human imaginations since time immemorial, is just a faded memory for one third of humanity and 80 percent of Americans, according to a new global atlas of light pollution produced by Italian, Israeli, and American scientists.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got whole generations of people in the United States who have never seen the Milky Way,\u201d said Chris Elvidge, a scientist with NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of our connection to the cosmos\u2014and it\u2019s been lost.\u201d\n\nThe artificial sky brightness levels are those used in legend and indicate the following: up to 1% above the natural light (black); from 1 to 8% above the natural light (blue); from 8 to 50% above natural nighttime brightness (green); from 50% above natural to the level of light under which the Milky Way is no longer visible (yellow); from Milky Way loss to estimated cone stimulation (red); and very high nighttime light intensities, with no dark adaption for human eyes (white).\n\nFor the purpose of this atlas, we set the level of artificial brightness under which a sky can be considered \u201cpristine\u201d at 1% of the natural background. The dark gray level (1 to 2%) sets the point where attention should be given to protect a site from a future increase in light pollution. Blue (8 to 16%) indicates the approximate level where the sky can be considered polluted on an astronomical point of view. The winter Milky Way (fainter than its summer counterpart) cannot be observed from sites coded in yellow, whereas the orange level sets the point of artificial brightness that masks the summer Milky Way as well. In areas that appear red, people never experience conditions resembling a true night because it is masked by an artificial twilight.\n\nTo learn more about this map, read the Science Advances paper. Also available is a book entitled, The World Atlas of Light Pollution.",

    "description": "The Global Lightning Dataset GLD360 network detects between 1 and 3 million lightning events around the world every day of the year. Lightning activity is not uniformly distributed across the globe. About ten times as many flashes occur over land than over the oceans, and the majority of global lightning is concentrated in the tropics. Over the course of a year, highest flash rate regions follow the inclination of the sun. The northern hemisphere sees more activity during June through August; the southern hemisphere has higher flash rates in January through March. These seasonal patterns can be clearly seen in these images, which show the total number of events detected in each month per square kilometer. The color scale ranges from less than .01 lightning pulses per square kilometer in the corresponding month to over 20 pulses per square kilometer. Each color range corresponds to a factor of two of increase in the number of events. This dataset runs from June 2011 through August 2012.\n\nGlobal lightning detection is monitored as lightning discharges generate broadband radio pulses that contain a peak component in the Very Low Frequency (VLF; 3-30 kHz) range, which are reflected off of the ground and the conductive region of the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere. GLD360 is a global, real-time long range lightning detection and location network that measures these VLF radio pulses at multiple sensors placed in strategic locations around the globe. The GLD360 network is maintained by Vaisala",

    "description": "Typically, more than 2,000 thunderstorms are active throughout the world at a given moment, producing on the order of 100 flashes per second. NASA has two different sensors on satellites that measuring flash frequency, the Optical Transient Detector, OTD, and the Lightning Imaging Sensor, LIS. Data from the OTD from 1995 - 2000 and the LIS from 1998 - 2005 has been combined and averaged to create an average annual lightning flash rate map. 11 year of data is included to remove any anomalies that might be present in just one year. The color variations in the map display the average annual number of lightning flashes per square kilometer.\n\nIt is clear from this map that the distribution of lightning flashes around the world is uneven. About 70% of all lightning activity occurs in the tropics. The location that receives the greatest number of flashes per year is near the small village of Kifuka in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The average annual flash rate for this location is about 158 flashes per year per square kilometer. In the United States, Florida has the highest annual flash rate with an average of 59 flashes per year per square kilometer. Thunderstorms occur most often during the summer, which means that there are only thunderstorms for part of the year. In Central Africa, the climate varies only slightly, allowing for thunderstorms to occur year round. The three key \"ingredients\" that are needed for a thunderstorm to develop are moisture, instability, and uplift. The moisture is needed for the clouds to develop. Instability in the atmosphere is caused by air that rises because it is warmer than its surroundings. Uplift is what forces the air to initially start rising. Rising air cools and condenses, forming clouds when there is enough moisture. Some examples of uplift mechanisms are mountains that block the path of the airflow, sunlight which warms the air causing it to rise, and front boundaries between weather systems. The land-sea temperature contrast around Florida makes it susceptible to thunderstorms.",

    "description": "Using satellite transmitting tags on wildlife allows scientists to monitor the behaviors of the wildlife in their natural habitats. This dataset contains the tracks of juvenile loggerhead sea turtles that were tagged and monitored. Some of the turtles were caught on commercial fishing vessels north of Hawaii and the other turtles were raised in the hatchery at the Port of Nagoya Aquarium in Japan. After being tagged the turtles were released at various at-sea locations. The data used in this dataset is from 1997 through 2006. The animation represents a daily climatology showing the turtle daily movement, independent of the year. The background is a daily climatology of satellite remotely-sensed sea surface temperature. The size of the turtle graphic is proportional to the turtle length.\n\nResearch from the National Marine Fisheries Service has shown that these turtles use surface chlorophyll and temperature gradients to determine their migration habits. In this dataset, the turtles generally remain in a narrow temperature band and move north and south seasonally with that temperature band. Also, the eastern region of the Kuroshio Extension Current near Japan represents an important mid-oceanic foraging hotspot, where many of the turtles in the dataset can be viewed.",

Circulation generally describes the pursuit of equilibrium in complex systems. There's never perfect equilibrium; it's an elusive target. When water settles on the surface of a pond, wind will set ripples in motion; where the coolness of night soothes atmospheric turbulence, daytime sunlight sets things swirling.\n\nAnchored in original scientific data visualizations, LOOP also features beautiful, inventive video sequences specially designed for spherical playback, and cool animation that helps convey the science in a high-energy format that's immediately accessible and emotionally engaging. The film explores Earth's thermohaline conveyor belt, atmospheric circulation, the water cycle, as well as general principals of circulation and equilibrium. Presented with a terrific original score and a great narrator with an extraordinary personal story--you can read more about him on our website-- LOOP excites the mind and the senses in a cinematic experience that you can only get on The Sphere.\n\nFor more information, visit the LOOP website at http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/loop\n\nLength of dataset: 10:12",

    "description": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a process that occurs several times each year from November-April in the atmosphere over the tropical Indian Ocean, the western tropical Pacific Ocean, and the surrounding land areas. MJO events alternate between periods of wetter-than-average and drier-than-average conditions, a cycle that lasts longer than typical weather systems do (1-2 weeks), but shorter than a season (90 days). The way that the MJO affects rainfall and drought patterns is important to the economies and livelihoods of the people that live in Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and Australia.\n\nThis animation shows the behavior of the MJO based on the average of many MJO events that occurred from 1979\u20142012. The MJO events were visible with polar-orbiting satellite sensors that measure cloudiness and rainfall using outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), which is closely related to convection and its associated rainfall. Therefore, green colors show regions of higher-than-average rainfall, while brown colors show regions of lower-than-average rainfall. The day counter shows the progression of consecutive days in the average 48-day cycle of the MJO, which since this dataset is an average over many years during winter, does not correspond to an exact date.",

It illustrates the estimated proportion of the general population that are infected with P. vivax at any one time, averaged over the 12 months of 2010. The stable transmission regions range from 0% to >7%. For example if a region has a 7% probability indicated this means that there is a 7% chance that someone within this 1 km squared region has contracted malaria within the year 2010.\n\nThe Duffy-negative layer attached to this dataset can be turned on by tapping \"Layers,\" toggling it on and turning down the transparency to view both images at once, where a relationship between vivax and Duffy-negative can be seen.\n\nAbout the layer: Duffy is one of many human blood groups. If a person exhibits a genetic mutation and does not have the Duffy protein, they are considered to have a Duffy-negativity. Individuals with Duffy-negativity tend to be resistant to vivax malaria which is one of five major human transmissible types of malaria. Duffy-negativity is common in African populations but is found in much smaller rates in other groups.\n\nThis map was constructed based on the distribution of common Duffy-negativity data. The darker the blue on the map layer, the higher the prevalence of Duffy-negative, white means 0-10% whereas the darkest blue indicates 98-100% of the population carries the mutation. Individuals with Duffy-negativity tend to be resistant to vivax malaria; therefore the higher the Duffy-negative occurrence, the lower the probability of vivax malaria.\n\nFor more information on the Malaria Atlas Project, please visit the MAP website.",

This narrated video, produced by the Florida State University in collaboration with NOAA, discusses the following topics:\n\nA team of scientists from the Florida State University used data about the types, amounts, and sources of plastic marine debris and combined these data with what is known about ocean currents, wind, and waves, to create the Global Marine Debris Model to visualize the movement of plastic debris in the ocean environment. The model shows the potential movement of marine debris throughout the ocean and areas of concentration such as gyres and hot spots.\n\nFinally, ideas on how we all can help are presented. The video shows how nations across the globe are connected by the ocean, that marine debris is a global problem caused by people, and can also be solved by all of us playing a part.

This introductory narrated video, produced by the Florida State University in collaboration with NOAA, discusses the following topics:\n\nThe video emphasizes that the ocean connects us all and that there is no place immune to marine debris. It also discusses how much debris reaches our ocean and the impacts it has on marine ecosystems.\n\nThe video highlights the work of Dr. Jenna Jambeck, a lead researcher on the amount of marine debris that enters our ocean globally. Her research served as a foundation for the Global Marine Debris Model developed by Dr. Chassignet's lab at FSU . This model allows us to visualize the path of marine debris from where it enters the ocean to where it is likely to end up (the video Global Marine Debris Model explores this model in more detail).\n\nFinally the video concludes with the clear message: everyone can help. By taking simple but powerful choices such as refusing, reducing, reusing, and recycling, we can make a huge difference in the amount of debris that enters our ocean. We can also take actions to reduce the debris that already pollutes our waterways by participating in community cleanups. By understanding the power of our actions, and the science of marine debris, we can make a difference in our ocean's future.\n\nLength of dataset: 4:54",

    "description": "This dataset contains the locations of a leatherback turtle, a northern elephant seal, and two white sharks for each day over the course of several months. The data used was taken from topp.org (TOPP stands for Tagging of Pelagic Predators), a site that tracks marine animals in an attempt to learn more about them. TOPP's goal is to protect marine wildlife from overfishing, climate change, and various other threats. The purpose of this dataset is to serve as an example of a hand-made animal tracking dataset. For a more extensive dataset using data from TOPP, go here.\n\nThe light green track represents a leatherback sea turtle's movements from January 25, 2004, to January 22, 2005. It was caught and tagged near the coast of Costa Rica before heading back out to sea. Leatherback turtles, also known as lute turtles, are born in tropical jungles near shore, but they can swim hundreds of miles north in search of their favorite foods: jellies. They are the largest species of sea turtle, sometimes reaching lengths of over six feet, and also hold the record for deepest divers - they can dive to over 1000 meters below the surface. Leatherback sea turtle populations are declining rapidly all over the world. To save them, we need a better knowledge of where they nest, where they migrate, and where their preferred habitats are.\n\nThe gold-brown track represents a northern elephant seal, from the time it was tagged off the coast of California on June 10, 2005, to March 7, 2006. Elephant seals have their name because the males (the bulls) have a long, floppy nose called a proboscis, similar to an elephant's trunk. Northern elephant seals (the species shown in this dataset) are slightly smaller than southern elephant seals, but travel much further - they are the only mammal known to make two long distance migrations per year. An elephant seal typically travels from a breeding colony in Mexico or California up to Alaska to hunt during their first migration, then returns to the breeding colony to molt its fur. Then it will return to Alaska to feed again, before coming back to the breeding colony a second time to mate. Elephant seals hunt for their food - sharks, large fish, crab, squid, and even octopus - by diving.\n\nBoth the white and the light blue tracks represent great white sharks, tracked over the same time period as the leatherback turtle. The largest white shark ever recorded was 6.4 meters long, although most white sharks are between 3.5 and 4.6 meters. White sharks have an extra sense that humans don't: electroreception, the ability to sense electricity. They use it to sense the position of their prey while they hunt. White sharks will also put their head above water, or occasionally, \"breach\" (jump) as high as two meters out of it to inspect their prey! White sharks can live almost as long as humans, with maximum lifespans of over 70 years. The species was once thought to live only near shorelines, but recent data from tagged sharks, such as the sharks shown here, has revealed that they are just as likely to spend their time far out in the Pacific.\n\nThis dataset was created using Quantum GIS (or QGIS, or Quantum Geographic Information System), which is a \"free, open source geographic information system.\" A tutorial is available that will walk you through the basics of using QGIS to create SOS-formatted maps, including this one. In addition to this dataset, the tutorial also walks through the creation of the Earthquakes and Nuclear Power Plants dataset and the Global Statistics dataset.",

    "description": "Microplastic pollution is a growing problem that affects beaches, aquatic life, and people's health. This narrated video, produced by the Science On a Sphere Program and NESDIS VizLab in collaboration with the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), discusses the following topics:\n\nThe video emphasizes that microplastics have been a growing problem in the marine environment for decades and humans are only recently starting to pay attention. It also discusses how microplastics reach our ocean and the impacts it has on marine ecosystems.\n\nThe video highlights the work of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) with Mississippi State University through their cooperative Institute, the Northern Gulf Institute, to collect and share information about microplastics around the world. This growing database is publicly offered through an ArcGIS web portal. The video uses screen captures of this portal to demonstrate the increase in surface microplastic observations over the past 50+ years.\n\nFinally the video concludes with the clear message: everyone can help. By making simple but powerful choices such as refusing, reducing, reusing, and recycling, we can make a huge difference in the amount of microplastic that enters our ocean. We can also take actions to reduce the plastic debris that already pollutes our waterways by participating in community cleanups. By understanding the power of our actions, and the science of marine microplastic, we can make a difference in our ocean's future.\n\nLength of Dataset: 7:22",

    "description": "Using satellite transmitting tags on wildlife allows scientists at NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Animal Telemetry Network to track and monitor the behaviors of the wildlife in their natural habitats. This dataset tracks one great white shark as it migrates in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nWhite sharks are found mostly in cool waters close to the coast. White sharks are considered super swimmers, reaching speeds of over 56 km/h (35 mph) depths of 1,200 m (3,900 ft). They can live to be as old as 70 and don't produce offspring until they are about 33 years of age. White sharks can grow to be 6m (18ft) long with 300 razor sharp teeth arranged in seven rows. This coupled with the famous Jaws movies has given white sharks a bad rap.\n\nThe great white shark has no known natural predators other than, on very rare occasions, the killer whale. The great white shark is arguably the world's largest known predatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish and seabirds.\n\nNew research reveals that Atlantic white sharks, which were hunted indiscriminately for almost two decades following the release Jaws, have slowly been making a comeback.

    "description": "According to many sources, a female humpback whale traveled over 10,000 km between breeding sites. She traveled from the reefs of Brazil to the African island of Madagascar, which researchers believe is the longest single trip ever undertaken by a mammal.\n\nHumpback whales are powerful swimmers, and the 40-ton mammals typically can travel up to 5,000 miles in their trips from the North Atlantic and the Antarctic to more temperate areas around the equator. They're known for their eerie songs which travel huge distances underwater and whose precise function remains a mystery. They're also cherished by whale-watchers for their spectacular out-of-the-water jumps, called breaching.\n\nIt was by browsing photo-sharing site Flickr that scientists found a photo of this particular humpback, taken by a Norwegian tourist from a whale-watching vessel off the coast of Madagascar in 2001. The photo had been taken with a film camera and the negative sat undeveloped in a drawer for years. Eventually, it was scanned and posted to the Web, where it was spotted and added to the catalog.\n\nThey were able to match the Flickr photo to a picture of the whale taken two years earlier in Abrolhos, an area of small volcanic islands off the Brazilian coast. The key to identifying humpback whales is in their tails!\n\nRead more about this amazing feat in this scientific paper. Learn more about Humpback Whales.",

    "description": "Using satellite transmitting tags on wildlife allows scientists at NOAA's Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Animal Telemetry Network to track and monitor the behaviors of the wildlife in their natural habitats. This dataset tracks one loggerhead sea turtle as it migrates between near shore and open ocean off the coast of Georgia.\n\nLoggerhead Sea Turtles were named for their relatively large heads, which support powerful jaws and enable them to feed on hard-shelled prey, such as whelks and conch. In the southeastern U.S., mating occurs in late March to early June and females lay eggs between late April and early September. Females lay three to five nests, and sometimes more, during a single nesting season. The eggs incubate approximately two months before hatching sometime between late June and mid-November.\n\nLoggerhead Sea Turtle populations face threats on both nesting beaches and in the marine environment. The greatest cause of decline and the continuing primary threat to loggerhead turtle populations worldwide is incidental capture in fishing gear, primarily in longlines and gillnets, but also in trawls, traps and pots, and dredges.\n\nThe most recent reviews show that only two loggerhead nesting beaches have greater than 10,000 females nesting per year: South Florida (U.S.) and Masirah Island (Oman). The status of the Oman nesting colony has not been evaluated recently. Total estimated nesting in the U.S. is approximately 68,000 to 90,000 nests per year.\n\nNOAA Fisheries is responsible for the stewardship of the nation's ocean resources and their habitat.

From the mesa that appeared to look like a face, to finding bacteria shaped objects on a meteor from Mars, humans have long explored the question of life on Mars. The mantra of NASA has been \"if we follow the water we might find life on this planet.\" The search for water on Mars has resulted in several missions with rovers exploring the planet. Researchers have found evidence of ancient water on Mars, though the current atmosphere of Mars is too thin to support water on the surface.

    "description": "A topographic view of Mars can be telling of the many distinguishing characteristics that it possesses. Mars is known to have several significant topographic features such as Olympus Mons, the highest peak in the solar system, and Valles Marineris, a canyon that easily dwarfs the Grand Canyon. The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, MOLA, an instrument used to determine the altitude, was in orbit, attached to the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. Since its launch in 1996, the instruments on the Mars Global Surveyor, such as MOLA, have been providing scientists with valuable information.\n\nThe altitude is determined by MOLA by transmitting a laser pulse toward the surface of Mars. By recording the flight time of the pulse, the distance between the spacecraft and the surface of Mars can be calculated. These range measurements are then used to create the topographic maps. Areas that are red and brown have higher altitudes while areas that are blue and green have lower altitudes.",

    "description": "Inspired by the books and lectures of geomorphologist Ellen Wohl (Colorado State University), \"Meander\" explores how you can understand the health of a river by looking at its shape. In addition, it considers the various impacts of human activity on riparian (wetlands adjacent to rivers) ecosystems.\n\nThe overall thesis is that rivers naturally tend towards \"complex\" shapes, whereas human activity tends to straighten them and reduce complexity. For example, in their natural state, rivers will tend to move freely across valley floors, periodically overtopping their banks and fertilizing the surrounding forest. However, human transportation corridors are often developed alongside rivers, and thereby constrain them into narrow, straighter channels.\n\nOne result of this is that the surrounding forests are not replenished with the nutrients that large river floods provide, and start to degrade and die off. Additionally, the straightening of the river reduces the complexity under the surface, making the overall flow speed of the river more uniform. This is distressing for many fish species, as they depend on slower and faster moving water for various different functions during their life cycle.\n\nVisit Michael Theodore's website here.\n\nLength of dataset: 4:48",

    "description": "The smallest planet in the solar system, Mercury is rocky and cratered with almost no atmosphere to serve as protection from meteors. As a result, many impact craters are visible on the surface. The most notable feature on Mercury is the Caloris Basin (also called Caloris Planitia), an impact crater with a diameter of over 950 miles. To better understand Mercury, NASA launched MESSENGER, the Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging spacecraft. Since it's launch in 2004, MESSENGER has been orbiting Mercury and has collected over 170,000 images of the planet.\n\nThis color enhanced view of Mercury builds upon the monochrome images of Mercury that have been created using MESSENGER imagery. You can see a monochrome version from MESSENGER here. While the monochrome view provides a view similar to what the human eye would see, this new colorful view of Mercury highlights the chemical, mineralogical, and physical differences between the rocks that make up Mercury's surface. Young crater rays, extending radially from fresh impact craters, appear light blue or white. Medium- and dark-blue areas are a geologic unit of Mercury's crust known as the \"low-reflectance material\", thought to be rich in a dark, opaque mineral. Tan areas are plains formed by eruption of highly fluid lavas. The giant Caloris basin is the large circular tan feature located in the northern hemisphere.",

    "description": "Mimas' low density suggests that the moon is mainly composed of ice with only a small portion of rock. The most distinguishing feature on Mimas is Herschel, an impact crater with a diameter of 80 miles, nearly one third the diameter of the moon. The walls of the crater rise up almost 3 miles above the surrounding surface, and within the crater, the depth is as low 6 miles. At the center of the crater there is a mountain 4 miles high, almost as tall as Mount Everest.\n\nIt is a wonder that the impact that caused the crater Herschel did not destroy the moon completely. Fractures are visible on Mimas on the opposite side of Herschel, indicating, that the impact had the potential to disintegrate the moon. The rest of the surface is covered in craters, though no others are as large as Herschel and the cratering is not uniform across the moon. Most portions of Mimas have some craters that exceed 25 miles in width, but near the South Pole, there are very few craters wider than 12 miles. Scientists are unsure what caused this uneven cratering.\n\nThe default map has enhanced color using infrared and ultraviolet filters, with saturation decreased that approximates natural color. Since Mimas is significantly out of round (shaped as a triaxial ellipsoid mainly from Saturn's tides), the apparent shapes of the craters that show on the sphere depend on the map projection used. The planetographic projection shows the crater shapes to be a bit non-circular. The layer map made using an earlier set of images is in black and white and shows the craters in a more realistic round shape.",

    "description": "Uranus has 27 moons, all of which are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five main satellites, in order of proximity to Uranus, are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Before the Voyager 2 studied Uranus in 1986, these five moons were the only ones known to exist.\n\nMiranda (a character in The Tempest by Shakespeare) has a surface unlike any other in the solar system. One theory for the jumbled appearance is that the moon has shattered and reformed up to five times, creating a surface of both young and old material. Another explanation involves the upwelling of partially melted ices.",

    "description": "The most visible change in the appearance of the Moon is its monthly cycle of phases. Every 29.5 days, the Moon changes from a thin crescent low in the western sky in early evening, to a full disk that rises at sunset and is up all night, back to a thin crescent rising just before sunrise. The Moon's phases are caused by its orbit around the Earth. As the Moon circles us, different parts of it face the sun. When the side of the Moon facing the Earth is sunlit, we see a full Moon. When the sun is up on the far side of the Moon, we see a thin crescent, or nothing at all.\n\nThis animation shows the sunlit and shadowed portions of the Moon over the course of a month. The video can loop continuously. Viewers on all sides of the sphere see a full progression of lunar phases like those visible from Earth. Viewers facing the near side of the Moon will also see Earthshine, light reflected from the Earth that faintly illuminates the night side of the crescent Moon.\n\nAmateur astronomers pay particular attention to features near the terminator, the line dividing day and night on the Moon. Long shadows and high contrast near the terminator bring out details in the terrain that are hard to see at other times. The animation uses elevation data from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's laser altimeter to recreate this sense of heightened detail near the terminator.",

With the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), NASA has returned to the Moon, enabling new discoveries and bringing the Moon back into the public eye. LRO launched on an Atlas V rocket on June 18, 2009, beginning a four-day trip to the Moon. LRO spent its first three years in a low polar orbit collecting detailed information about the Moon and its environment. After this initial orbit, LRO transitioned to a stable elliptical orbit, passing low over the lunar south pole.\n\nWhile in orbit, LRO observations have enabled numerous groundbreaking discoveries, creating a new picture of the Moon as a dynamic and complex body. These developments have set up a scientific framework through which to challenge and improve our understanding of processes throughout the solar system.\n\nThe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) orbits the Moon from pole to pole, which enables some instruments aboard the spacecraft to image the entire surface of the Moon over the course of a lunar day (28 Earth days). The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), one of the seven instruments aboard LRO, has provided this high-resolution map of the Moon. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera is made up of a Narrow Angle Camera, which is used to image the Moon in sub-meter scale resolution, and a Wide Angle Camera (WAC), which images the Moon at a much lower resolution, but can image more of the Moon's surface at one time. The visible light image shown here is a global mosaic of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009 and February 2011 by the LROC WAC camera.\n\nThe near side of the moon has light areas referred to as Lunar Highlands and dark areas called Maria.

Areas illuminated by the Sun (white and red) can reach temperatures hot enough to boil water, while areas in shadow (blue) reach temperatures hundreds of degrees below freezing.\n\nThe extreme temperature environment on the Moon is of interest for planning future human and robotic exploration missions because engineers must design equipment to withstand the drastic shifts in temperature over the course of a lunar day (28 Earth days). Scientists also study the Moon's temperature in order to determine where water might be stable at or below the surface. The Diviner instrument has identified permanently shadowed areas inside crater rims near polar regions as the most likely places to find surface and subsurface water ice.\n\nDiviner is also mapping compositional variations in lunar rocks and soil by measuring the intensity of infrared light measured in three channels, distinct from the thermal channels described above. This information helps scientist unravel the Moon's geologic history and understand how it formed.\n\nFor more information on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, visit: NASA LRO or regarding the Diviner instrument the Diviner Mission website.",

    "description": "As our nearest neighbor, the Moon is a natural laboratory for investigating fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of the Earth and the solar system. With the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), NASA has returned to the Moon, enabling new discoveries and bringing the Moon back into the public eye. LRO launched on an Atlas V rocket on June 18, 2009, beginning a four-day trip to the Moon. LRO spent its first three years in a low polar orbit collecting detailed information about the Moon and its environment. After this initial orbit, LRO transitioned to a stable elliptical orbit, passing low over the lunar south pole.\n\nWhile in orbit, LRO observations have enabled numerous groundbreaking discoveries, creating a new picture of the Moon as a dynamic and complex body. These developments have set up a scientific framework through which to challenge and improve our understanding of processes throughout the solar system.\n\nLOLA is the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter, an instrument onboard LRO that determines the global topography of the lunar surface at high resolution. LOLA data sets are produced by the LOLA Science Team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD and numerous locations across the US.\n\nLOLA produces topographic data by firing a laser at the lunar surface and detecting the two-way travel time for the signal. LOLA's single laser, which is fired 28 times per second, is split into five beams by a diffractive optical element. LOLA sends a total of 140 pulses to the lunar surface each second, which enables the instrument to gather high resolution topographic data.\n\nThis particular dataset shows the Moon's topography. The amount of time it takes for the laser pulses to return to LOLA's receiver onboard the LRO spacecraft indicates how far it is from the lunar surface, which can be used to create a topographic map of the lunar surface. The LOLA instrument onboard LRO has measured the altitude of more than 6 billion points on the lunar surface, so that scientists now have better topography for the Moon than any other planetary body in the solar system! Red and white indicate high altitudes and blue and purple indicate low altitudes\n\nOther datasets available from LRO LOLA are Surface Roughness and Surface Slope.\n\nLinks for more information about LOLA instrument and the LRO spacecraft.",

DSCOVR stands for Deep Space Climate Observatory and orbits the Earth 930000 miles away. It is at a special balance point called L1 where it always stays near a line connecting Earth and Sun. The images taken by EPIC always show a nearly fully lit Earth, rotating below with the land masses and cloud systems coming into view. The animation shown is a special case where the moon is passing in front of the Earth. If you look at SOS from a point where the Earth is fully lit, then the moon will appear properly round. This so-called lunar transit happens several times a year as seen from DSCOVR.\n\nNote that the moon is fully lit as well in these images, though compared with the more reflective clouds on the Earth the appearance is a darker gray, instead of the brilliant white we see when looking at the full moon from Earth at night. The reflectance of the moon is roughly the same as the dry land masses on Earth and darker compared with the white clouds. Note that the contrast of these images is slightly higher than one would actually see if magically aboard the DSCOVR satellite.",

    "description": "Neptune is the eighth planet in the solar system at an average distance of 2.8 billion miles from the Sun. Due to the eccentric orbit of Pluto, Neptune becomes the ninth planet for a period of 20 years every 248 Earth years. The blue coloring is the result of methane in the atmosphere, though the exact reason for the vividness of the blue is still unknown. The axis of the magnetic field and the axis of rotation are off by 47\u00b0 on Neptune causing wild variations in the magnetic field, which is 27 times stronger than Earth\u2019s. Also, six rings which appear to be young, encircle Neptune.\n\nThe winds that whip around Neptune are on average nine times faster than those on Earth and are believed to be the strongest winds in the solar system. Storms much like the Great Red Spot on Jupiter have been seen on Neptune. Unlike the Great Red Spot, which has been observed for over 300 years, the storms on Neptune seem to come and go. In 1986 the Voyager 2 discovered the Great Dark Spot, a storm in the Southern Hemisphere. However, later images from the Hubble Space Telescope show that the Great Dark Spot no longer exists and that a new storm formed in the Northern Hemisphere. Also, there is a group of white clouds referred to as The Scooter which races around the planet every 16 hours. The Scooter is thought to be a plume from lower in the atmosphere, though its true origin is unknown.",

    "title": "Nitrogen Dioxide",
    "description": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a key component of urban air pollution. The nitrogen oxides (\"NOx\" of which NO2 is one component) are emitted from any combustion process. Coal- and gas-fired power plants and vehicles constitute the major anthropogenic (human-produced) sources. Forest fires and lightning are natural sources of NO2, but globally it is clear that anthropogenic sources dominate. High levels of NO2 are significant as they are associated with: 1) haze that reduces visibility; 2) irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs; 3) acid rain; 4) reduced terrestrial plant growth; 5) oxygen-depleting algal blooms; and 6) corrosion of building materials.\n\nBecause of the importance of trace pollutants such as NO2 for air quality and human health around the world, instruments have been developed and installed on research satellites to measure NO2 on Earth. Collaborative teams from space agencies around the world build the sensors and retrieval algorithms to make these space-based images available to the world scientific and policy-making communities.\n\nThis animation shows a time series of NO2 measured from such satellites from October 2004 to December 2009. These particular images were captured by the Dutch-Finnish Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Earth Observing System AURA satellite. One of the objectives of the AURA mission is to measure trace pollutants such as NO2, ozone, carbon monoxide, and aerosols by their interaction with light of visible and non-visible wavelengths. These data have been converted to false-color images so the viewer can \"see\" hot spots in NO2 concentration around the globe.\n\nNO2 is a pollutant with a relatively short atmospheric lifetime, so it does not get transported far from its source. Thus, these satellite images provide a direct indication of where NO2 sources are located. In remote, unpolluted regions of the globe, NO2 will be uniformly low.\n\nSeveral striking observations can be made from this global view of the NO2 air pollutant. First, the dominant NO2 source regions correspond primarily to areas with high population and large industry, for example, eastern China, northern Europe, and the eastern United States. Because most electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels in power plants that emit NO2, these hot spots are strongly correlated with electricity usage and fuel sources.\n\nSecond, urban centers show up as smaller hot spots. High vehicle traffic leads to elevated NO2. For example, Mexico City, Tokyo, and Los Angeles are all clearly marked by their NO2 plume. If one zooms in to California, the north-south transit corridor of the I-5 freeway is actually visible from space via its NO2 signature.\n\nThird, a clear seasonal pattern is apparent. In the northern hemisphere winter, peak NO2 is much higher in all the northern hemisphere hot spots. This is attributed both to heavier use of combustion power plants for wintertime home heating, as well as the fact that NO2 stays in the air longer in the winter. The atmospheric lifetime of NO2 is driven primarily by reactions initiated by sunlight. With less sunlight in the wintertime, reactions that break down NO2 are not easily initiated, and the NO2 is removed more slowly from the atmosphere. Urban areas report NO2 air quality standard \"exceedance\" events, when the level of this pollutant is higher than deemed safe by environmental agencies. This happens most frequently during the cold winter months.\n\nSimilarly, one sees hot spots over urban centers in the southern hemisphere during their local winter (June - September). In addition, some years see spread out elevated regional NO2 over southern Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa, typically peaking in September. This is the signature of \"biomass burning,\" when large swathes of forest burn in those regions. Some seasonal burning is apparent in northern Australia as well. These are significant contributions to southern hemisphere NO2 but are dwarfed in comparison to northern hemisphere industry.\n\nFinally, we can look for evidence of a long-term trend in regional NO2 emissions. Comparing December 2009 to December 2004, there is higher regional NO2 in China compared to North America or Northern Europe in 2009. This correlates with China's booming economy in recent years. In December of 2004 the relative amounts of NO2 over these regions was more consistent. This can be attributed both to economic activity as well as to effective policy efforts to reduce NOx emissions in some countries.\n\nThese satellite datasets provide a rich basis for interpretation of urban/rural, seasonal, and decadal (long-term) trends in air quality.",

    "title": "Ocean-Atmosphere CO2 Exchange - Climate Model: SSP5 (Fossil-fueled Development) - 2015 - 2100",
    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, the ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide is shown as projected by the SSP5 scenario, using GFDL\u2019s ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP5-8.5 is a very high greenhouse gas emissions scenario - and unlikely to happen - where carbon dioxide emissions triple by 2075. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nWhen carbon dioxide, CO2, is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels, approximately 50% remains in the atmosphere, while 25% is absorbed by land plants and trees, and the other 25% is absorbed into certain areas of the ocean. In other areas of the ocean, where the concentration of CO2 is higher in the water than in the atmosphere above, CO2 is released to the atmosphere.\n\nThis transfer of CO2 out of the ocean to the atmosphere is referred to as a positive \"flux\" while a negative flux means that the ocean is absorbing CO2. The ocean has a complicated pattern of both positive and negative fluxes. Prior to the Industrial Revolution and the burning of fossil fuels, the net global ocean flux was slightly positive to offset the absorption of CO2 by land plants. Today, humans have reversed that trend so the oceans absorb more CO2 than they release although the complicated pattern of positive and negative fluxes still exists.\n\nRegions of upwelling (the equatorial Pacific and the west coast of South America) are natural sources of CO2, where old water with high concentrations of CO2 is brought to the surface, and the excess CO2 is degassed into the atmosphere. Colder regions are capable of absorbing more CO2 than warm regions, so the polar regions tend to be sinks of CO2 (see the North Atlantic and Arctic). As atmospheric CO2 increases from the burning of fossil fuels, more regions of the ocean absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and the global ocean source and sink regions are no longer in balance. By 2100, much of the global ocean is expected to be a sink of CO2 from the atmosphere. As this CO2 dissolves into the ocean, it alters the ocean chemistry and lowers the pH of the water.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: OnlySSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.",

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, the ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon dioxide is shown, using GFDL\u2019s ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP1-1.9 is a very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario where carbon dioxide emissions cut to net zero around 2050. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nWhen carbon dioxide, CO2, is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels, approximately 50% remains in the atmosphere, while 25% is absorbed by land plants and trees, and the other 25% is absorbed into certain areas of the ocean. In other areas of the ocean, where the concentration of CO2 is higher in the water than in the atmosphere above, CO2 is released to the atmosphere.\n\nThis transfer of CO2 out of the ocean to the atmosphere is referred to as a positive \"flux\" while a negative flux means that the ocean is absorbing CO2. The ocean has a complicated pattern of both positive and negative fluxes. Prior to the Industrial Revolution and the burning of fossil fuels, the net global ocean flux was slightly positive to offset the absorption of CO2 by land plants. Today, humans have reversed that trend so the oceans absorb more CO2 than they release although the complicated pattern of positive and negative fluxes still exists.\n\nRegions of upwelling (the equatorial Pacific and the west coast of South America) are natural sources of CO2, where old water with high concentrations of CO2 is brought to the surface, and the excess CO2 is degassed into the atmosphere. Colder regions are capable of absorbing more CO2 than warm regions, so the polar regions tend to be sinks of CO2 (see the North Atlantic and Arctic). As atmospheric CO2 increases from the burning of fossil fuels, more regions of the ocean absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and the global ocean source and sink regions are no longer in balance. By 2100, much of the global ocean is expected to be a sink of CO2 from the atmosphere. As this CO2 dissolves into the ocean, it alters the ocean chemistry and lowers the pH of the water.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: OnlySSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.",

    "description": "Ocean acidification is an often overlooked consequence of humankind's release of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. Excess carbon dioxide enters the ocean and reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which decreases ocean pH (i.e., makes seawater less basic), and lowers carbonate ion concentrations. Organisms such as corals, clams, oysters, and some plankton use carbonate ions to create their shells and skeletons. Decreases in carbonate ion concentration will make it difficult for these creatures to form hard structures, particularly for juveniles. Ocean acidification may cause some organisms to die, reproduce less successfully, or leave an area. Other organisms such as seagrass and some plankton species may do better in oceans affected by ocean acidification because they use carbon dioxide to photosynthesize, but do not require carbonate ions to survive. Ocean ecosystem diversity and ecosystem services may therefore change dramatically from ocean acidification.\n\nThis datasets shows computer model simulations of surface ocean aragonite saturation state from 1861 to 2100, based on historical data and future projections of carbon dioxide emissions, with continents and coral reefs in purple marked. Aragonite saturation state is commonly used to track ocean acidification because it is a measure of carbonate ion concentration. Aragonite is one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate and is widely used by marine calcifiers (organisms with calcium carbonate structures). Corals and other calcifiers are more likely to survive and reproduce when the saturation state is greater than three. When aragonite saturation state falls below 3, these organisms become stressed, and when saturation state is less than 1, shells and other aragonite structures begin to dissolve. The predicted pH decrease of approximately 0.3 units during the 21st century would be a greater change than possibly at any time in the last 300 million years.\n\nThe model simulation is driven with atmospheric emissions based on records of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for past dates, and the CMIP5 IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario for future dates (approx. 950 ppm atmospheric CO2 by 2100).",

Excess carbon dioxide enters the ocean and reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which decreases ocean pH (i.e., makes seawater less basic), and lowers carbonate ion concentrations. Organisms such as corals, clams, oysters, and some plankton use carbonate ions to create their shells and skeletons. Decreases in carbonate ion concentration will make it difficult for these creatures to form hard structures, particularly for juveniles. Ocean acidification may cause some organisms to die, reproduce less successfully, or leave an area. Other organisms such as seagrass and some plankton species may do better in oceans affected by ocean acidification because they use carbon dioxide to photosynthesize, but do not require carbonate ions to survive. Ocean ecosystem diversity and ecosystem services may therefore change dramatically from ocean acidification.\n\nIn this dataset, surface ocean aragonite saturation state is shown as projected by the SSP2 scenario, using GFDL\u2019s ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP2-4.5 is an intermediate greenhouse gas emissions scenario where carbon dioxide emissions continue around current levels until 2050, then decrease but do not reach net zero by 2100. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nAragonite saturation state is commonly used to track ocean acidification because it is a measure of carbonate ion concentration. Aragonite is one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate and is widely used by marine calcifiers (organisms with calcium carbonate structures) to build their shells and calcium carbonate structures. Corals and other calcifiers are more likely to survive and reproduce when the saturation state is greater than three. When aragonite saturation state falls below 3, these organisms become stressed, and when saturation state is less than 1, shells and other aragonite structures begin to dissolve.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: OnlySSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.",

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records.

    "description": "Climate and Earth system models are used for a variety of purposes - from the study of dynamics of the weather and climate system of the past to projecting future climate. These models simulate the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, land and oceans, and require massive supercomputers to generate climate projections.\n\nAn international team of climate scientists, economists and earth systems modelers have built a range of new \"pathways\" that examine how global society, demographics and economics might change over the next century. They are collectively known as the \"Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\" (SSPs). World Climate Research Programme climate modeling working group, through international science coordination and partnerships, designed the framework for these climate models to inform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, AR6.\n\nNOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has created several fully coupled climate and earth system models that can utilize the SSPs to glimpse into the future. Global climate models represent the planet as millions of grid boxes and then solve mathematical equations to calculate how energy is transferred between those boxes using the laws of thermodynamics. If done correctly, these models of how energy is cycled through all parts of the planet can be used to estimate dozens of environmental variables (winds, temperature, moisture, ocean acidification, etc.). The models are tested by simulating historical conditions and then matching the results to our historical observational records. If the models can adequately recreate the past, they are then run forward in time to project what may happen in the future.\n\nIn this dataset, surface pH is shown as projected by the SSP2 scenario, using GFDL\u2019s ESM4 model between 2015 and 2100. SSP2-4.5 is an intermediate greenhouse gas emissions scenario where carbon dioxide emissions continue around current levels until 2050, then decrease but do not reach net zero by 2100. The resolution of the climate model is 1/4 degree for the oceans and 1 degree for the atmosphere.\n\nRanging from 0 to 14, pH is a scale that describes the acid and base properties of a solution. The ocean's surface has an average pH of around 8.1, which is slightly basic. The pH of the open ocean is relatively stable in both time and space; however, the uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean has caused measurable changes in seawater. Ocean acidification is an often overlooked consequence of humankind's release of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere from fossil fuel burning. Excess carbon dioxide enters the ocean and reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which decreases ocean pH (i.e., makes seawater less basic), and lowers carbonate ion concentrations.\n\nOrganisms such as corals, clams, oysters, and some plankton use carbonate ions to create their shells and skeletons. Decreases in carbonate ion concentration will make it difficult for these creatures to form hard structures, particularly for juveniles. Ocean acidification may cause some organisms to die, reproduce less successfully, or leave an area. Other organisms such as seagrass and some plankton species may do better in oceans affected by ocean acidification because they use carbon dioxide to photosynthesize, but do not require carbonate ions to survive. Ocean ecosystem diversity and ecosystem services may therefore change dramatically from ocean acidification.\n\nAlthough the pH changes appear small, pH is on a log scale meaning that a change of one unit represents an order of magnitude change in the acidity of the seawater. Ocean acidification, a lowering of ocean pH, has the potential to significantly impact marine ecosystems by the end of this century.\n\nFor more information on understanding SSPs we found this carbonbrief.org article very informative.\n\n(Note: OnlySSP1, SSP2 and SSP5 are available on SOS)\n\nThe world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.\n\nThe world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.\n\nA resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.\n\nHighly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.\n\nThis world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo-engineering if necessary.\n\nNarratives for each Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, from Riahi et al 2017.\n\nFor more technical information on the World Climate Research Programme go to the Earth System Grid Federation.",

    "description": "When carbon dioxide CO2 is released into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels, approximately 50% remains in the atmosphere, while 25% is absorbed by land plants and trees, and the other 25% is absorbed into certain areas of the ocean. In other areas of the ocean, where the concentration of CO2 is higher in the water than in atmosphere above, CO2 is released to the atmosphere.\n\nThis transfer of CO2 out of the ocean to the atmosphere is referred to as a positive \"flux\" while a negative flux means that the ocean is absorbing CO2. The ocean has a complicated pattern of both positive and negative fluxes. Prior to the Industrial Revolution and the burning of fossil fuels, the net global ocean flux was slightly positive to offset the absorption of CO2 from the land plants. Today, humans have reversed that trend so the oceans absorb more CO2 than they release although the complicated pattern of positive and negative fluxes still exists.\n\nRegions of upwelling (the equatorial Pacific and the west coast of South America) are natural sources of CO2, where old water with high concentrations of CO2 is brought to the surface, and the excess CO2 is degassed into the atmosphere. Colder regions are capable of absorbing more CO2 than warm regions, so the polar regions tend to be sinks of CO2 (see the North Atlantic and Arctic). As atmospheric CO2 increases from the burning of fossil fuels, more regions of the ocean absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, and the global ocean source and sink regions are no longer in balance. By 2100, much of the global ocean is expected to be a sink of CO2 from the atmosphere. As this CO2 dissolves into the ocean, it alters the ocean chemistry and lowers the pH of the water.\n\nThe model simulation is driven with atmospheric emissions based on records of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for past dates, and the CMIP5 IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario for future dates (approx. 950 ppm atmospheric CO2 by 2100). This dataset starts in 1861 and runs through 2100.",

    "description": "The ocean is not a still body of water. There is constant motion in the ocean in the form of a global ocean conveyor belt due to thermohaline currents. These currents are density driven, which are affected by both temperature and salinity. Cold, salty water is dense and sinks to the bottom of the ocean while warm water is less dense and rises to the surface. The \"start\" of the ocean conveyor belt is in the Norwegian Sea. Warm water is transported to the Norwegian Sea by the Gulf Stream. The warm water provides heat for the atmosphere in the northern latitudes that gets particularly cold during the winter. This loss of heat to the atmosphere makes the water cooler and denser, causing it to sink to the bottom of the ocean. As more warm water is transported north, the cooler water sinks and moves south to make room for the incoming warm water. This cold bottom water flows south of the equator all the way down to Antarctica. Eventually, the cold bottom waters are able to warm and rise to the surface, continuing the conveyor belt that encircles the globe. It takes water almost 1000 years to move through the whole conveyor belt.\n\nThere are two datasets that illustrate the ocean circulation. This dataset is an animation that shows the movement of the ocean conveyor belt and the second dataset is a still image that has the major ocean currents labeled. Surface waters are the red lines and cold, bottom waters are the blue lines. Changes in ocean circulation could have drastic impacts on the climate. The transport of heat associated with the ocean conveyor belt partially moderates the cold temperatures in the North. As the poles warm due to climate change, melt water from ice and glaciers enters the ocean. This fresh melt water has the potential to slow or even shut off the ocean circulation, which is dependent on temperature and salinity. The density of the fresh melt water is less than that of salty ocean water. This causes the fresh melt water to form a layer on the surface that can block the warm, salty ocean water from transporting heat to the atmosphere. The effect would be a cooling of the higher latitudes. If the warm water is not able to give off heat, it can not cool and sink to the bottom of the ocean. This would disturb the circulation of the entire ocean conveyor belt and have a noticeable impact on the climate in the northern latitudes.",

    "description": "Approximately 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean, where algae not only release oxygen during photosynthesis, but also serve as the base of most oceanic food webs. Since satellites can measure the different wavelengths of light that are absorbed by the planet surface and reflected back to space, scientists can use that data to calculate how much green pigment associated with the algae is contained in the surface waters. Chlorophyll pigment strongly absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light and reflects green. Data from the NASA SeaWiFS, NASA Aqua and NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellites have been used by NOAA to monitor oceanic chlorophyll concentration (also called ocean color) since 1997. This data has been instrumental in understanding global productivity, carbon cycling, fisheries habitats, and biochemical oceanography.\n\nIn this imagery, areas of the ocean with lower amounts of surface chlorophyll are colored blue, areas with higher concentrations are colored green to yellow. The large patches of gray are areas where the satellite cannot measure the ocean surface due to cloud cover. The areas of gray over the poles during their respective winters is due to the lack of sunlight in those regions. This real-time dataset is updated monthly and frames from the last year are included. In this year long loop, seasonal variations can be seen.",

    "description": "This animation shows daily values of the ocean surface relative vorticity as simulated by the Parallel Ocean Program (POP). Vorticity, which can be thought of as the rate of fluid rotation, is particularly useful for visualizing ocean turbulent flow, highlighting the presence of swirling eddies. A significant amount of the total kinetic energy in the world ocean is attributable to these turbulent motions, making them an important component in balances of energy, momentum, heat, salt, and chemical constituents (such as carbon dioxide) throughout the globe.\n\nColors in the animation reflect both direction and strength of the vorticity. Green eddies rotate the same direction as the earth and orange eddies rotate the opposite way. Additionally, the darker the color, the stronger the rotation. The strongest eddies are typically associated with instabilities of sea surface currents, such as the Gulf Stream off the eastern coast of the United States, the Agulhas Current off the tip of Africa, and the Kuroshio Current east of Japan. Some of the longest living vortices are created by the Agulhas Current, which can take years to cross the Atlantic Ocean. But what is clear is that there are eddies just about everywhere in the ocean that span quite a range of strengths, sizes, and lifetimes.",

    "title": "Ocean Surface Winds",
    "description": "The SeaWinds scatterometer, carried aboard NASA's QuikSCAT satellite, is a microwave radar designed to measure the backscatter related to near-surface wind speed and direction over the oceans. A rougher ocean surface returns a stronger signal because the waves reflect more of the radar energy back toward the scatterometer antenna (backscatter), and a smoother ocean surface returns a weaker signal because less of the energy is reflected. Given the known relationship between the roughness of the surface and the strength of the wind, it is possible to compute the wind speed and direction - the wind vector - from multiple observations of the signal returned from a given area on the ocean surface.\n\nMeasurements of the global sea-surface wind speed and direction, observed by QuikSCAT, are important to meteorologists and oceanographers in the preparation of marine weather forecasts and the issuance of warnings for the high seas. These include forecasts of the strength and track of hurricanes and winter storms, forecasts that are important to emergency response, offshore oil production and commercial shipping. Wind information is also used in forecasts of waves and ocean currents. The measurements are also important in observing and understanding the global manifestation of phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Winds are related to key processes in the hydrological cycle (evaporation and precipitation), to the energy cycle (through evaporation and other energy fluxes), and the CO2 budget.\n\nNASA's QuikSCAT mission carrying the SeaWinds scatterometer was launched in June 1999 and has been operating ever since.\n\nFor more information click here; information about other scatterometers and scatterometer products and animations can be found here. More information about near realtime operational products can be found here.",

    "title": "Ocean Temperature at Depth - Seasonal",
    "description": "Though satellites provide highly detailed analyses of the temperature of the ocean surface, they cannot measure temperatures below the first 1 mm of water. For that deeper understanding, NOAA relies on thousands of buoys, ships, undersea gliders and other devices to measure temperatures at depth. The measurements are consolidated every few years by the National Oceanographic Data Center into a product known as the World Ocean Atlas. The measurements shown here go as deep as 5,000 m \u2014 far deeper than many places in the ocean \u2014 which is why there is a lack of data (black areas) in some of the deeper imagery.\n\nThis dataset provides a look at how ocean temperature changes each season through the depths of the ocean. For each season (three month averages January - March, April - June, July - September, and October - December) there are six depths available: surface, 100m, 500m, 1,000m, 2,000m, and 5,000m. Ocean temperatures get colder with depth. Cold water has a higher density than warm water. Water gets colder with depth because cold, salty ocean water sinks to the bottom of the ocean basins below the less dense warmer water near the surface. The sinking and transport of cold, salty water at depth combined with the wind-driven flow of warm water at the surface creates a complex pattern of ocean circulation called the 'global conveyor belt.' Another trend to notice is that ocean temperatures at the surface vary dramatically from season to season, but that variation becomes less and less as the depth increases. In these frames, past a depth of 500m (1640ft), ocean temperatures are fairly consistent from season to season.",

    "description": "This short film serves as an introduction into looking at Earth from space and it inspires us to consider the value of doing so in light of our changing climate.\n\nAs the film opens we imagine the sense of wonder and astonishment that, decades ago, occurred each time a ground-breaking image of Earth was returned from off-world. Humanity has always gazed upward to the stars. Now, we are finally looking back. This new perspective seems to rekindle a deeper appreciation for our living and breathing planet. It is beautiful and fragile. It is home.\n\nIn 1990, thanks to a suggestion from Carl Sagan, we have the famous Voyager 1 image of Earth; an image he later dubbed the \"Pale Blue Dot\". This image often gets visually intertwined with the Apollo 17 image from 1972, the \"Blue Marble\". Our story examines each of these images, among other famous early images of Earth from space. Ultimately we are connected to the present as we study global climate and its changes. While Our Pale Blue Dot offers a stroll down memory lane - yes, there are the voices of the Apollo 8 astronauts taking in their first Earth rise - there is more than sentimentality at work. We truly hope to build an appreciation for looking at the Earth from space-something many in modern society take for granted.\n\nAnd so our film moves from single images of Earth to today's extraordinary satellite imagery. We rely daily on accurate weather forecasts via the legacy of the TIROS program. But there's more. Earth observing satellites and their continuously streaming data have provided us with decades of information about our planet's vital signs: sea ice cover, ocean temperature, greenhouse gases and vegetation - to name just a few. And what do we see?\n\nWe see much more than a snap shot of our beloved home. We see amazing details. We see all those seemingly insignificant little things adding up to a big picture. And that big picture is of us...we humans...and our Earth. The only planet we've ever called home is changing before our eyes.\n\nWhile our film was truly independent and not funded by NASA or NOAA, it makes significant use of many public domain photographs and data visualizations. As filmmakers, we are indebted to the scores of people and years of hard work which make these images possible.\n\nIn the related dataset section below, we are able to highlight the Science On a Sphere datasets that we used as source material to create this movie. These could serve as a starting point to format a longer docent-led script and discussion. Source materials courtesy: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA Scientific Visualization Studio, NOAA Science On a Sphere and NOAA Visualization Lab. ISS video courtesy of the Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, NASA Johnson Space Center. Launch and historical footage by NASA & NOAA & JAXA.\n\nPlease visit our website, where we will showcase much of the NASA and NOAA source content used; as well as a collection of resources to in-depth material regarding the science of climate change.\n\nMovie length: 7:38\n\nNOTE: This film is freely available to the entire Science On a Sphere network, however it is not in the public domain. No segment of the film may be repurposed, re-edited or distributed in any way other than its original format, and must be shown in its entirety.

    "title": "Ozone: Stratospheric - Real-time",
    "description": "Ozone is a gas made of three oxygen atoms, and just like any other gas it circulates in the atmosphere. The stratospheric ozone layer is critical because it protects Earth from harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. Areas with ozone concentrations less than 220 Dobson Units are called \"holes\" in the layer. The Antarctic ozone hole is formed each year in the Southern Hemisphere spring (September-November) when there is a sharp decline (currently up to 60%) in the total ozone over most of Antarctica. During the cold dark Antarctic winter, stratospheric ice clouds (PSCs, polar stratospheric clouds) form when temperatures drop below -78C. These very cold clouds are responsible for chemical changes that promote production of chemically active chlorine and bromine. When sunlight is combined with the chlorine and bromine in the Antarctic Spring, there is an activation that leads to a rapid ozone loss, which results in the Antarctic ozone hole. Although some ozone depletion also occurs in the Arctic during the Northern Hemisphere spring (March-May), wintertime temperatures in the Arctic stratosphere are not persistently low for as many weeks which results in less ozone depletion. The production of ozone is high near the equator, but due to atmospheric circulation transporting the ozone to the poles, the equator tends to be a region of relatively low ozone through the year.\n\nScientific evidence, accumulated over more than two decades of study by the international research community, has shown that human-produced chemicals are responsible for the observed depletions of the ozone layer. The ozone-depleting compounds contain various combinations of the chemical elements chlorine, fluorine, bromine, carbon, and hydrogen and are often described by the general term halocarbons. Through an international agreement known as the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, governments have decided to eventually discontinue production of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform (except for a few special uses), and industry has developed more \"ozone-friendly\" substitutes. All other things being equal, and with adherence to the international agreements, the ozone layer is expected to recover over the next 50 years or so. NOAA's polar orbiting satellites are used to monitor the ozone hole and the data taken from the POES satellites is processed and made available on a daily basis in near real-time.\n\nFor more information, visit NOAA's Stratospheric Ozone Page",

    "description": "Every year, particles eroding from the continents are transported to the oceans by the wind as dust and by rivers as sands and gravels. Once they get to the ocean, they mix with billions of tons of dead plankton shells, sink, and settle on the seafloor. There, they accumulate vertically in layers on top of previous years\u2019 material. Similarly, this year\u2019s snow accumulates on top of the previous years\u2019 snow at the polar regions in places like Greenland and Antarctica. Over time, this process forms new layers of ice. Trees, much the same way, add yearly layers of new cells in concentric circles just below their bark \u2013 called tree rings. And, in many caves around the world, the strength of the seasonal cycle of a wet monsoon followed by a dry season is recorded in the chemistry of stalagmites rising up from the cave floor, formed by drips of mineral-rich water from the roof of the cave.\n\nPaleoclimatologists have learned that all of these yearly processes are sensitive to changes in regional climate, allowing them to be used like \u201cnatural thermometers,\u201d or what scientists call \u201cpaleoclimate proxies.\u201d For the last several decades, Paleoclimatologists have been collecting data from these natural archives of environmental change and using them to explore how climate change occurs naturally. Together with our observations of present climate, the data collected from these natural thermometers tells us that the climate changes we are observing today are unique with respect to much of Earth\u2019s recent history.\n\nFor example, the bubbles filled with ancient atmosphere and trapped in the layers in ice cores show us that heat-trapping gases haven\u2019t been at the levels they are today in nearly 800,000 years, and likely for millions of years. Similarly, tree rings show us that recent human-caused warming trends far outpace any natural warming the Earth did by itself over much of the last few thousands of years. These paleoclimate proxies can also tell us about nutrient cycling in the ancient ocean, the amount and pattern of past precipitation events throughout the tropics, the extent and magnitude of recent volcanic eruptions, and many other things \u2013 in fact, scientists are constantly discovering new and imaginative ways to leverage these natural archives of environmental change to help us understand present and future changes to our global climate.\n\nThe SOS NOAA Paleoclimatology dataset citation and access spreadsheet contains URLs that can be used to access citation information, and the actual data for the over 6,000 datasets represented in this presentation.",

    "description": "The two moons of Mars hold several distinctions in the solar system. Phobos, the innermost moon of Mars, is the closest moon to any planet in the solar system. Phobos is less than 3700 miles (6000 km) from the surface of Mars. In contrast, the Earth's moon is 240,000 miles (384,400 km) from the Earth. Deimos, the outermost and smaller moon of Mars, is one of the smallest known moons in the solar system. Both of moon's names are derived from the Greek language. Phobos is Greek for fear and Deimos is Greek for panic\n\nMany scientists believe that Phobos and Deimos are captured asteroids from the outer solar system, but there are other scientists who counter this idea. Both moons have a low density, which means that they cannot be made of pure rock, but rather a mixture of rock and ice. Another similarity between the two moons is that they are both heavily cratered. Deimos does have a slightly smoother appearance due to the filling of some of its craters. One of the main features on Phobos is a large impact crater. The impact was so severe that scientists think the impact probably came close to shattering the moon. Striated patterns from the impact can be traced over a large portion of the landscape of Phobos.",

    "description": "Phoebe is the first satellite to be discovered photographically. It is over eight million miles away from Saturn, over four times farther from Saturn than its nearest neighbor, the moon Iapetus. Originally thought to be a captured asteroid, Phoebe was found to contain carbon dioxide, which has never been found on an asteroid. Phoebe is now thought to be either a comet or Kuiper Belt object (an area that extends from the orbit of Neptune out to 4.7 billion miles from the sun). One reason for believing Phoebe to be a comet or Kuiper Belt object is its highly unusual orbit. While most of Saturn\u2019s moons orbit around its equator, the plane of Phoebe\u2019s orbit is 175\u00b0 from the equator of Saturn. Also, the moon rotates retrograde.\n\nWhile most of the moons of Saturn are composed mainly of ice and therefore have relatively high albedos (reflectivity), Phoebe is estimated to be composed of 50% rock and is known to have a very low albedo of .06. The dark coloring is part of the reason that it was first hypothesized that Phoebe was an asteroid. The surface of Phoebe is not only dark but also heavily scarred and cratered, with several substantial craters. Only in 2000, when several smaller new moons were discovered, was it determined that Phoebe is not the farthest moon from Saturn.",

    "description": "Phytoplankton are the base of the marine food web and are crucial players in the Earth's carbon cycle. They are also incredibly diverse. This visualization shows dominant phytoplankton types from 1994-1998 generated by the Darwin Project using a high-resolution ocean and ecosystem model. The model contains flow fields from 1994-1999 (generated by the ECCO2 model), inorganic nutrients, 78 species of phytoplankton, zooplankton, as well as particulate and dissolved organic matter. Colors represent the most dominant type of phytoplankton at a given location based on their size and ability to uptake nutrients. Red represents diatoms (big phytoplankton, which need silica), yellow represents flagellates (other big phytoplankton), green represents prochlorococcus (small phytoplankton that cannot use nitrate), and cyan represents synechococcus (other small phytoplankton). Opacity indicates concentration of the phytoplankton as carbon biomass.\n\nThe large phytoplankton (red, yellow) have fastest growth rates and dominate where there are lots of nutrients to nourish them at high latitudes and near the equator where nutrient-rich water upwells from the deep ocean. On the other hand, the small phytoplankton (green, blue) are more competitive where nutrients are very low.\n\nA key part of the Darwin Project is developing theoretical and numerical models of the marine ecosystems. The data shown here are from a simulation of the Darwin model in a physical run of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) general circulation model by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) group. The model provides a laboratory to explore the controls on biodiversity and the biogeography of different phytoplankton species. In particular, the role of the swirls and filaments (mesoscale features) appear important in maintaining high biodiversity in the ocean.",

    "description": "When you think of a day, you normally think of one cycle through one day and one night. That is called a solar day. Another way to measure a day is to count the amount of time it takes for a planet to completely spin around and make one full rotation. This is called a sidereal day. On Earth, a sidereal day is almost exactly 23 hours and 56 minutes.\n\nWe know how long an Earth day is, but how about the other planets in our solar system? How long does it take for those planets to spin one full rotation? And what is the best way to show the answer to this question?\n\nThe simple answer is:\n\nIn this dataset, it's possible to see all 8 planets on the sphere rotating at once and we have set Earth's ~24 hour day/rotation to happen in 60 seconds. Next to each planet's name, we have listed the time it takes for each planet to make one full rotation as well as the speed each planet moves at its equator. Jupiter, for example, makes one rotation in 9h 55m but moves 27 times faster than Earth at its equator, spinning at a whopping 45,583 km/h!\n\nWe have included two PIPs (picture in pictures) that can be toggled on for further explanation related to this concept. A PIP of the approximate sizes of the planets relative to each other and a PIP illustrating that if you viewed all the planets from the same point and at an angular diameter of 30 degrees - about ten feet from the sphere - each planet would appear to have a similar size.\n\nInspiration to add this dataset to our catalog came from a video that we ran across by Dr James O'Donoghue.",

    "description": "Our planet's surface has been shaped and re-shaped by plate tectonics through cycles of supercontinent amalgamation and breakup. We can study the motion of the tectonic plates, and the continents that they carry, by measuring the magnetic signatures recorded in rocks that form the seafloor. As plates move apart at mid oceanic ridges (also known as seafloor spreading centers), lava from the Earth's mantle fills the void that is being created and solidifies as basalt, which can capture the magnetic polarity of the planet at the time. As the magnetic polarity reverses irregularly over time, we can use this barcode pattern to determine the age of the oceanic crust across all the world's oceans. Teams of geologists, geophysicists and marine scientists use ocean-going scientific vessels to criss-cross the oceans in order to reveal the entire \"barcode\" of seafloor spreading histories. This data enables the creation of \"plate tectonic reconstructions\" where the seafloor spreading history can be unwound to restore the past position of continents as they are pushed and pulled by the motion of the oceanic plates.\n\nThis animation of seafloor spreading and plate tectonic evolution of the planet since 200 million years ago is created from a synthesis of marine geophysical data (namely, the magnetic anomalies) and geological data on the continents. The grey regions represent continental areas, while the light brown regions represent the reconstructed position of present-day coastlines (for reference). The rainbow coloured regions represent the age of oceanic crust through time that is modelled from magnetic anomalies collected from the ocean floor. Plate boundaries are plotted to show the evolving network of narrow deformation zones that accommodate the motion of plates - including mid oceanic ridges and transforms (black lines), and subduction zones (teethed magenta lines). Dark grey regions represent areas of volcanism (known as Large Igneous Provinces) that are related to large upwellings of hot material from mantle plumes. The animation is derived from a powerful scientific tool, forming the basis of numerical simulations of oceanic circulation, deep-time climate change, and planetary-scale geodynamic modelling of mantle convection.\n\nThe plate motion model that is visualized here is from: Gibbons, A., Zahirovic, S., Muller, R., Whittaker, J., and Yatheesh, V., 2015, A tectonic model reconciling evidence for the collisions between India, Eurasia and intra-oceanic arcs of the central-eastern Tethys: Gondwana Research FOCUS.\n\nRead more here: A tectonic model reconciling evidence for the collisions between India, Eurasia and intra-oceanic arcs of the central-eastern Tethys",

    "description": "Pluto is the brightest dwarf planet that is located in the Kuiper belt, a ring of small icy bodies outside the orbit of Neptune. It was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Pluto was \"classically\" known as the ninth planet until 2006 when the International Astronomical Union set up new guidelines for qualifications of a planet. Pluto didn't meet all the qualifications and is now considered a dwarf planet. Pluto averages an astounding distance of 3,670,050,000 miles from the Sun. It is very small 1500 miles in diameter, placing it even smaller than seven of the moons found in the solar system. It has been determined that Pluto has a bright layer of methane, nitrogen and carbon monoxide ice near the surface with 70% rock and 30% water ice mostly underneath in its bulk composition. Some of the detail that is visible on Pluto is the presence of polar ice caps as well as large dark spots near the equator. The surface temperature of Pluto varies between -391\u00b0F and -346\u00b0F. The \"warmer\" temperatures loosely correspond to the darker areas. Pluto has five known satellites, the largest of which is Charon. Charon's diameter is over half the diameter of Pluto, making Charon the biggest moon with respect to the planet it orbits. Because of this, Pluto is often referred to as a double planet. A new mission called New Horizons was launched in 2006 and flew by Pluto in July 2015, and is providing a spectacular increase in knowledge about Pluto with ongoing images and data being transmitted back to Earth expected through 2016.\n\nThis view is constructed mostly from New Horizons images. Some of the southern hemisphere is filled in by previous imagery taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. New Horizons spacecraft made its closest approach to Pluto, flying by so quickly that there wasn't any time for all of Pluto to rotate into view. Thus some longitudes are seen only at lower resolution from a greater distance. Also, much of the southern latitudes are in winter darkness, and it will take a century or so for them to be well seen.\n\nWhen Pluto is closest to the sun some of the frozen gases sublimate and create a very thin atmosphere. A deep but tenuous haze layer extends up to 60-100 miles above the surface. With the very cold temperatures present, ices of substances such as nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and water ice cover the surface. Some of the mountainous areas may be made of water ice, and the white heart-shaped region called Tombaugh Regio has areas of carbon monoxide ice and some of the flattest terrain seen. This has a provisional name of Sputnik Planum and shows evidence of flowing ices. A dark \"Whale\" shaped feature (provisionally called Cthulu Regio) wraps around Pluto to the lower left (southwest) of the \"Heart\".",

    "description": "This is an animation showing the history of knowledge of Pluto's surface over the last few decades. In the 1990s the best images were available were from a combination of the Hubble Space Telescope and studies of eclipses of transits between Pluto and its largest moon Charon. As we can see in the animation, at such a great distance from Earth, even the Hubble Space Telescope has difficulty viewing Pluto in any real detail. During 2015 several stages of approach by the New Horizons spacecraft are shown with a great wealth of detail being visible for the first time. However, even in the most recent frame, New Horizons spacecraft made its closest approach to Pluto, flying by so quickly that there wasn't any time for all of Pluto to rotate into view.

    "description": "Satellites are important to scientists because the instruments on board can provide almost daily global coverage of the Earth that would otherwise not be available. There are six instruments on board NASA's Aqua satellite. One of them is MODIS, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. MODIS measures 36 spectral frequencies of light, which provide a wealth of information about the physical properties of the atmosphere and the biological and physical properties of the oceans and land. The Aqua satellite with MODIS attached was launched May 4, 2002. Since then, Aqua has been circling the Earth at an altitude of 438 miles (705 kilometers) every 99 minutes in a polar orbit passing within 10 degrees of each pole every orbit. The orbit is sun-synchronous, which means that the satellite passes over the same spot of the Earth at about the same local time everyday. Aqua crosses the equator from south to north at about 1:30 pm local time.\n\nThis dataset shows the path of the Aqua satellite and MODIS swath over a period of one day, August 27, 2005. The swath of data collected by MODIS is over 1400 miles (2300km) wide. This means that MODIS is able to measure almost the entire Earth surface everyday. MODIS only collects data when it is on the sunlit side of the Earth because it measures reflected light from the Sun. The bright band that appears in the middle of some of the swaths is reflected sunlight off of the ocean. By August 27, 2005 Hurricane Katrina had crossed Florida and was strengthening in the Gulf of America. That hurricane, as well as Typhoon Talim in the western Pacific between Japan and New Guinea, is visible in this dataset.",

    "description": "Satellites allow scientists to observe the Earth from above the atmosphere. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has several different types of satellites, including geostationary and polar orbiting satellites. These datasets show the path of Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites, or POES for short. NOAA has two POES in operation currently, a morning and afternoon satellite. The morning satellite crosses the equator on the sun-light side of the Earth in the morning, and the afternoon satellite crosses in the afternoon. Both satellites orbit the Earth 14.1 times per day.\n\nThere are two datasets that show the NOAA POES, which are NOAA-17 and NOAA-18. This dataset follows the path of NOAA-17, the morning satellite, and displays the IR data that the satellite collects over a 13 hour period on February 14, 2007. The IR data is overlaid on top of the NASA blue marble image. The satellite is able to provide full coverage of the Earth in less than 13 hours. POES satellites are about 510 miles above the Earth's surface and collect a swath of data that is 1740 miles wide. The other dataset, Sunsynchronous Satellite, follows NOAA-18 and shows the path of the satellite along with the day/night terminator for one day on December 22, 2007. NOAA-18 is the afternoon satellite, which crosses the equator in the afternoon. The satellite parallels the night-time side of the terminator. Each orbit for these satellites only takes 102 minutes. They are able to orbit the Earth so quickly because they are traveling almost 17,000 mph. If Science On the Sphere were the actual size of the Earth, the height of the POES orbit would be 4.5 inches above the surface.",

NOAA 15 was launched in 1998, NOAA 16 was launched in 2000, NOAA 17 was launched in 2002 and NOAA 18 was launched in 2005. In May and August of 2007 two older satellites, NOAA 14 and NOAA 12 respectively, were decommissioned. These satellites orbit the Earth in such a way that they pass over the poles. Each orbit takes approximately 102.1 minutes, allowing the satellites to circle the Earth about 14.1 times each day. The polar orbit enables the satellites to collect daily global data for land, ocean, and atmospheric applications. This data is used a large variety of environmental monitoring applications such as weather analysis and forecasting, climate research and prediction, global sea surface temperature measurements, ocean dynamics research, global vegetation analysis and many other applications.\n\nTwo of the satellites are classified as A.M. satellites and the other two are classified as P.M. satellites, which indicate the time that they cross the equator. These satellites provide full global coverage four times daily. All of the satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of over 500 miles. The NOAA satellites are managed by NESDIS, the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service. This dataset shows the tracks of the NOAA POES satellites. NOAA 15 is yellow, NOAA 16 is red, NOAA 17 is green, NOAA 18 is blue and the International Space Station is also included and is shaded pink.",

    "description": "Until 2010, the longest globally-complete estimate of the four-dimensional atmospheric circulation was from a dataset produced jointly by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research: the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis. This dataset of computer-generated weather map reconstructions or \"reanalyses\" starts from 1948, leaving many important climate events such as 1930's Dust Bowl drought uncovered. To expand the coverage of global gridded reanalyses, the 20th Century Reanalysis Project is an effort led by NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory Physical Sciences Division and the University of Colorado CIRES Climate Diagnostics Center to produce a reanalysis dataset spanning the entire twentieth century, assimilating only surface observations of synoptic pressure, monthly sea surface temperature and sea ice distribution. The pressure observations have been assembled through international cooperation under the auspices of the Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative, ACRE, and working groups of the Global Climate Observing System and World Climate Research Program. The Project uses a recently-developed Ensemble Filter data assimilation method which directly yields each six-hourly reanalysis field or weather map as the most likely state of the global atmosphere, and also estimates uncertainty in that map. This dataset will provide the first estimates of global tropospheric variability spanning 1871 to present at six-hourly temporal resolution and 2 degree longitude by 2 degree latitude resolution.\n\nThere are 3 sample animations of the data available for Science On a Sphere\u00ae. All three animations are showing columnar averaged precipitable water (that is, the total amount of water vapor there is in a column extending from the surface to the top of the atmosphere). Water isn't directly assimilated into the 20th Century dataset but is produced by the atmospheric circulation interacting with water sources such as the oceans. It is a good tracer of atmospheric motions.\n\nThis dataset shows the atmosphere throughout the two years of 1902 to 1903. The dot that appears in the Antarctic Region is the location of one of the many sources of observed data that were included in the reanalysis. In this case, it is the ship \"Discovery\" frozen in the ice continuously for two years. The Discovery was the vessel used for the British National Antarctic Expedition of 1901-1904. Among their many scientific observations, frequent pressure measurements were taken on board the ship and have been included in the reanalysis. The scientific expedition was perceived as a success and launched the careers of many famous explorers including Ernest Shackleton and Captain Robert Scott.\n\nThe second datasest, Precipitable Water - El Nino 1917-1919 , illustrates a La Nina(1917) and El Nino (1919).\n\nThe third dataset, Precipitable Water - Galveston Hurricane, illustrates the hurricane that made landfall on Galveston, Texas on Sep 8 1900.\n\nThe Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project used resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and of the National Center for Computational Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which are supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 and Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725, respectively.\n\nMore information of the 20th Century Datasets along with the ability to plot the data can be found on the NOAA/ESRL PSD's 20th Century Reanalysis Documentation Web Page",

    "description": "The atmosphere contains an enormous amount of moisture that circulates around the globe. However, not all of it actually condenses into rain, sleet, or snow since the right balance of pressure and temperature are needed to create precipitation. Total precipitable water (TPW) in the atmosphere is the amount of water that can be obtained from the surface to the \"top\" of the atmosphere if all of the water and water vapor were condensed to a liquid phase. Significant features that can be identified in TPW data are the atmospheric rivers that flow off the oceans and onto coastal land areas. A famous example is the Pineapple Express that forms in the Northeast Pacific and impacts the Northwest United States. Also notice how TPW values are much greater over the equator and ocean. High levels of evaporation in these areas are one of the primary drivers of atmospheric circulation.\n\nThe land, ocean, and atmosphere all emit microwave radiation which can be measured by sensors on satellites, allowing scientists to study various aspects of the Earth. Microwave sounders are able to measure very low levels of microwave radiation naturally emitted by the Earth at different frequencies. Even water vapor emits microwave radiation that can be measured by microwave sounders. Data for this dataset comes from the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) on the Suomi NPP satellite. Seven polar-orbiting satellites contribute such data to create these images.",

    "description": "Precipitation (falling rain and snow) that occurs around the globe is the source of fresh water on which all life depends. Even in the tropics, much of the precipitation begins as snow in the clouds high above the surface, then generally melts as it falls into warmer temperatures near the surface, except when the surface temperature is below freezing. The heaviest precipitation is found in the persistent band near the Equator, known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Just outside the ITCZ, more noticeably in the Northern Hemisphere, the tight swirls of tropical storms (including hurricanes and typhoons) can be seen occasionally in the northern summer. At subtropical latitudes in both hemispheres there are persistent dry areas associated with subtropical high pressure centers. The major deserts of the world occur in the subtropical highs, but these highs also cover vast regions of the oceans. At midlatitudes, the storm tracks display the swirls of low pressure systems and bands of frontal precipitation. [Note the opposite directions of circulation in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres!] Important year-to-year and shorter-interval variations cause strong modifications to local conditions, bringing droughts and floods.\n\nPrecipitation changes the naturally occurring microwave energy emitted by the Earth's surface and atmosphere. These signals are detected by satellite instruments that are attuned to specific microwave frequencies. In addition, a few satellites carry weather radars, providing data to adjust the estimates of precipitation from the microwave instruments. Finally, sometimes it is useful to estimate precipitation from information about cloudiness that is provided by infrared sensors flying on geostationary satellites (geo-IR).\n\nThis NASA GPM IMERG dataset is provided to Science On a Sphere in near-real time, about six hours after the observation. This dataset uses information from as many satellite microwave sensors as possible, and includes satellite radar data for calibration and geo-IR for additional information. The satellite data provide observations at each location about every three hours or less, and smooth transitions from one observation to the next are computed to give estimates every half hour.",

The second\u2013the SOS dataset\u2013adapts this visualization for Science on a Sphere, but without captions. Also included in the FTP link is a backgrounder, which provides additional content information\u2013helpful for creating live presentations using these datasets.\n\nAs global climate changes and alters natural habitats, wild animals are shifting where they live on Earth. Protecting them requires connecting crucial protected areas so species can move safely among the habitats they need to survive.\n\nThis visualization uses the wolverine as an example\u2013a northern species particularly sensitive to climate change. It maps wolverines' bioclimatic envelope\u2013a model of the specific climatic conditions that the species requires to survive\u2013and then projects ways this envelope may shift as the climate warms. The piece also highlights how connecting habitats with wildlife corridors gives species such as the wolverine a better shot at survival in a warming world.\n\nSpring temperature: The red and blue temperature anomaly data reflect the March/April/May average for a 30-year period (1980-2009) relative to the 20th century average. Data provided by NOAA NCDC and processed by Ned Gardiner, NOAA Climate Program Office.\n\nWolverine range: The yellow outline delineates where wolverines are currently found around the world. Data source: IUCN/Roland Kays.\n\nWolverine \"prime habitat\": The mapped yellow area reflects the bioclimatic envelope of wolverine in the United States as of 2012. Data processed by ecoclim.org.\n\nMultidecadal projections: The time series projects the wolverine's bioclimatic envelope in 2040, 2070, and 2090, suggesting how much currently suitable habitat may disappear during each of these scenarios. The pair of 2090 scenarios compares the portion of the bioclimatic envelope that is projected to remain under a \"business as usual\" trend of greenhouse gas emissions (left; SRES A2) with a level of emissions that reflects a significant effort to transition to greener energy sources (right; SRES B1). Data processed by ecoclim.org.\n\nConnected habitat: The green area overlapping the yellow indicates the portion of the wolverine's projected bioclimatic envelope in 2090 that would be within the boundaries of current national parks and other protected areas. The green outline indicates the boundaries of Yellowstone to Yukon, a proposed habitat corridor. (See Backgrounder for more information.)\n\nProtected areas: The green polygons on the last frames of the animation are global protected areas from the World Database of Protected Areas and the US Protected Area Database.",

    "description": "The GDELT Project is \"an initiative to construct a catalog of human societal-scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world, connecting every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what's happening around the world, what its context is and who's involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day.\" Essentially the GDELT Project monitors the world's news media each day and uses sophisticated computer algorithms to compile from it a daily catalog of over 300 categories of events from attacks and protests to peace appeals and diplomatic exchanges.\n\nThere are two inaugural GDELT visualizations for the Science on a Sphere that offer snapshot of human society as seen through the eyes of the world's news media, pinpointing every protest and incidence of violence against a civilian worldwide each day monitored by GDELT. This dataset offers a historical view, covering the period January 1, 1979 through May 2014. The second GDELT dataset is a real-time view of events over the past year.

    "description": "The GDELT Project is \"an initiative to construct a catalog of human societal-scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world, connecting every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what's happening around the world, what its context is and who's involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day.\" Essentially the GDELT Project monitors the world's news media each day and uses sophisticated computer algorithms to compile from it a daily catalog of over 300 categories of events from attacks and protests to peace appeals and diplomatic exchanges.\n\nThere are two inaugural GDELT visualizations for the Science on a Sphere that offer snapshot of human society as seen through the eyes of the world's news media, pinpointing every protest and incidence of violence against a civilian worldwide each day monitored by GDELT. This dataset offers a near real-time view, covering the last year up through yesterday. The second GDELT dataset is a historical view of events from January 1, 1979 through May 2014. Locations of protests are colored in pink/purple, while incidents of violence against civilians are colored in red. The size of the dot at each location represents the volume of news coverage reporting on events taking place at that location on that day (a larger red dot means more news coverage of one or more violent attacks on that day in that location).

    "description": "After the devastation of the Indian Ocean Tsunami on December 26, 2004, much attention has been given to tsunami research. The National Center for Tsunami Research, which is part of the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, spearheaded the research efforts in the United States. A tsunami is a series of waves generated when a body of water, such as the ocean, is rapidly displaced on a massive scale. This is most likely to happen where the tectonic plates meet and create trenches. An earthquake in these regions can cause one plate to subduct under another and displace huge amounts of water. One location that has garnered much attention from scientists is the Puerto Rico Trench, the deepest location in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis visualization shows the possible impact an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude in the Puerto Rico trench would have on the United States East Coast. The propagation model used was created by NOAA\u2019s National Center for Tsunami Research. The bathymetry of the ocean floor can focus wave energy and steer waves. The location of the earthquake in this simulation was chosen to show the widespread impact that a tsunami can have on the entire East Coast of the United States. In particular, the location was determined based on a sensitivity study for inundation in Virginia. The yellow shading represents the crest of the wave, which is over 10cm above sea level and the red shading represents the trough of the wave, which over 10cm below sea level. The purple shading shows subsequent peaks 0 - 10cm high and the green shading equates to subsequent troughs 0 - 10cm.",

    "description": "Globally, rain is the main source of fresh water for plants and animals rainfall is essential for life across Earth\u2019s landscapes. In addition to moving tremendous amounts of water through Earth\u2019s atmosphere, rain clouds also move tremendous amounts of energy. When water evaporates from the surface and rises as vapor into the atmosphere, it carries heat from the sun-warmed surface with it. Later, when the water vapor condenses to form cloud droplets and rain, the heat is released into the atmosphere. This heating is a major part of Earth's energy budget and climate.\n\nThe rainfall maps show total monthly rainfall in millimeters as recorded by NASA\u2019s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, which is a joint mission between NASA and the Japanese Space Agency. High rain totals are represented in dark blue, while small rainfall totals are shown in white. TRMM measures rainfall in the tropics. High-latitude regions, where TRMM does not record rainfall, are gray.\n\nView, download, or analyze more of these data from NASA Earth Observations.",

To commemorate the mission and champion the value of future planned lunar expeditions, the Space Agency is pleased to present RETURN TO THE MOON.\n\nStarting with a brief historical look back at the legacy of human achievement in lunar exploration, the movie presses audiences to take stock in their own relationship to the moon. Then it takes them on a journey. Travelling along with the LRO spacecraft, viewers will discover some of the essential scientific subjects that scientists plan to study. They'll follow LRO as it makes orbits around the moon, gathering data about the surface and what may lie beneath. And then, in a dramatic demonstration of a daring mission goal, moviegoers will witness a moment of inventive drama when NASA engineers intentionally crash a research probe into the surface of the moon to dig beneath the top layer. The space agency calls that impact probe LCROSS, and as both a research tool and a cinematic experience, it promises to deliver something exciting.\n\nPlease note that this production comes in two different versions. The so-called \"future\" version is what venues should be playing prior to the launch of the LRO mission, scheduled for sometime in mid-2009. The \"present\" version is what venues should play following the launch of the probe.\n\nFor more information, visit the Return to the Moon website.\n\nLength of dataset: 5:17",

The composition and surface features of Rhea are remarkably similar to those of Dione, another moon of Saturn. Both moons have a similar composition as well as a heavily cratered leading hemisphere and a lightly cratered trailing hemisphere covered with bright streaks. Although there is not substantial proof that the bright streaks on Rhea are ice cliffs, this is the accepted explanation because they appear to be the same as those on Dione, which are proven ice cliffs.\n\nThe moon can also be divided into two geologically different areas based on crater density. Near the poles and equator, smaller craters are found suggesting that they are younger than the other regions, where craters with diameters larger than 25 miles can be found. This has lead scientists to believe that a major resurfacing event probably occurred during formation.",

    "description": "This dataset illustrates hydrological conditions worldwide for the year 2010. The data originates from a computational model, the Water Balance Model (WBM). WBM takes daily rainfall and temperature data, maps of vegetation, land-use, irrigation and soil properties, and then calculates the hydrological balance for each of its grid cells.\n\nYou can see the effect of large storms moving over the Earth's land masses - as they dump rain and snow the runoff can be seen as the pulsating dark yellow areas throughout entire regions and river basins. Using the magnifying glass (zoom feature on the iPad remote app) you can view some of the largest rivers in the world as their discharge seasonally changes. The largest river in the world is the Amazon River in South America. It encompasses almost 40% of South America, and its drainage basin is in the subtropical climate zone. Much of the Amazon basin is wet from January to June, seen as bright red. Extensive flooding happens during this time. The river floodplain widens in places to 50 km wide, and people have adapted to this flooding by building floating houses, or houses on stilts.\n\nOther large river systems fluctuate even more due to seasonal rainfall. The Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers in India and Bangladesh, and the Mekong River in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam receive almost all of their rainfall from June to September during the Asian monsoon season. River discharge peaks in August and September in this region in Asia. Farmers in India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam use the monsoonal rain water to irrigate their rice crops, while in the dry season the fields may lay fallow. Use the magnifying glass to see the Congo River in Africa discharge increase starting in March and the Yangtze River in China increase in June.\n\nAnother aspect of the seasonality of the hydrological cycle is illustrated by the melt of snow. In the model, snow will only melt when temperatures are warm enough. Snow melt on warm days can be seen in April in the northern states of the US, and it progresses further northward over the spring and summer. Arctic Rivers like the Mackenzie River in Canada have large peaks in their runoff in May or June due to the contribution of snow melt.\n\nThis global hydrology model was run for 50 years at a daily time step with climatological data ingested from a compiled dataset of 1000's of meteorological stations (Cohen et al., 2013). The model routes runoff to streams and rivers and ultimately river water drains downstream to the ocean. 2010 was chosen as the example year, and you can see what was the daily average of water discharge (in m3/sec) for each model pixel of roughly 55 x 55 km. A logarithmic color scale was used because discharge in the headwaters can be orders of magnitudes smaller (light-green) than accumulated discharge from many tributary rivers in the most downstream parts of large river basins (up to red).\n\nEducational materials have been developed for this dataset, including a few PowerPoint slides, that can be used on a supplementary screen while viewing the dataset on Science On a Sphere\u00ae or in a classroom. Also, a discussion-based lesson plan as well as an answer key, which can be used to facilitate student learning about global river discharge differences and changes.\n\nCohen, S., Kettner, A., Syvitski, J., Fekete, B., 2013.

This dataset shows three of the 36 colors (wavelengths) the instrument detects, corresponding to red, green, and blue---the colors the human eye can see. Using these data, scientists can track dust being blown out of the desert and across the oceans, see ash clouds from fires and volcanic eruptions, and can even locate floods and large landslides. The Aqua satellite is a polar-orbiting satellite, orbiting once every 99 minutes at an altitude of 705 km (438 miles). It is also sun-synchronous, crossing the equator south to north around 1:30 pm in the local time zone. As daytime moves around the world, the satellite follows, building up a sunlit picture of the entire Earth over 24 hours. At its highest resolution, the instrument can detect features as small as 250 meters across.\n\nBecause this instrument requires sunlight to operate (it's like a digital camera in many respects), the pictures taken at night aren't shown. Consequently, near the poles where night lasts for months on end, large areas of missing data develop during the winter. As the equinox approaches, the holes shrink and data coverage improves. This dataset is near real-time, with a three day lag in imagery. The data is consistently updated to always contain the images over the past week.",

    "description": "Satellites are a key tool for scientists to monitor and observe the Earth's atmosphere from space. Geostationary satellites orbit around the Earth at the same rate as the Earth rotates so that the satellites are over the same spot on Earth all the time. This allows them to collect a continuous stream of data for one location so that \"movies\" of the data can be made. The satellites are positioned 22,300 miles above the Earth's surface in order to view the Earth's full disk and to maintain their geostationary orbit. Geostationary satellites travel at about 7000mph in order to maintain their geostationary orbit. In addition to geostationary satellites, scientists also use polar orbiting satellites. These satellites circle the Earth, crossing the poles on each orbit. Typically, polar orbiting satellites are about 500 miles above the Earth's surface. The satellites travel at almost 17,000mph, allowing them to orbit the Earth in roughly 100 minutes. A polar orbiting satellite is able to cover the whole Earth in less than one day.\n\nThere are hundreds of scientific satellites orbiting the Earth. This dataset shows the positions of seven geostationary satellites and the tracks of several polar orbiting satellites, plus the location of the International Space Station over one day, February 15, 2007. The day/night terminator is also included in this dataset. Each of the polar orbiting satellites travel at slightly different heights, allowing them to pass by one another without crashing.",

    "description": "Since the late 1900s, Arctic sea ice has thinned, and less sea ice has persisted in the Arctic over multiple melt seasons. The trend toward younger, thinner sea ice over time reflects warming temperatures in the Arctic. As older ice is thicker than younger ice, the reduced area of old ice also indicates a reduction in the total volume of ice.\n\nColors show the age of sea ice floating in the Arctic Ocean. The darkest blue areas on the map show seasonal or first-year ice, which formed during the most recent winter. White areas show where ice is more than four years old. Ice thickness is strongly correlated with ice age. First year ice ranges from 4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 centimeters) thick, while multiyear ice ranges from 6 to 12 feet (2 to 4 meters) thick. This correlation means that in general, the brighter the color, the thicker the ice. Note that data for the sea ice age is not available along the coastlines.\n\nScientists estimate the age of sea ice by combining satellite observations of ice locations and extent with buoy data on winds and motion. The temporal coverage for this data set is weekly data from January 1984 through December 2020.\n\nThe input ice motion data used for this data set is derived from the Polar Pathfinder daily 25 km EASE-Grid Sea Ice Motion Vectors Version 4 data set.\n\nTschudi, M., W.

    "description": "Sea ice is simply ocean water that has frozen. At least 15% of the ocean is covered by sea ice some part of the year. This means that on average, sea ice covers almost 10 million square miles (about 25 million square kilometers) of the Earth. Sea ice is monitored closely by scientists because changing sea ice coverage can have a huge impact on the rest of the globe. Global warming is amplified in polar regions. Because of this, monitoring changes in sea ice can be a good indicator of climate change. The National Snow and Ice Data Center monitors sea ice using a passive microwave satellite data record that begins in 1978. The Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) is the current monitoring instrument. This sea ice extent dataset is on a 25km cell size grid covering both Arctic and Antarctic polar regions.\n\nThis dataset shows sea ice concentration every ten days from 1978 - 2022. This dataset shows the growth and decay of sea ice concentration throughout the year. In the Arctic, the maximum coverage occurs in March and the minimum coverage occurs in September usually. The opposite is true for Antarctic, where the minimum occurs in March and the maximum occurs in September. An interesting point to note is that the extent of sea ice in the Arctic is shrinking, while the Antarctic sea ice is not trending downward.\n\nSea ice extent is constantly changing; to stay up to speed visit The Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis blog at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",

    "description": "Arctic sea ice extent is declining at a rapid rate; the extent in September, 2019 was about 30% lower than the average September extent over 1980-2010. Sea ice in both hemispheres can be easily monitored now, with data from a series of satellites that have been operating since the late 1970s. Every year, NOAA publishes the Arctic Report Card. In it, scientists summarize how sea ice, along with snow cover, tundra greenness, marine algae, caribou, and other indicators of change are responding to warming that is taking place about two times faster in the Arctic than elsewhere on the planet.\n\nBut how did Arctic sea ice vary in the months, years, and decades before satellites? The history of Arctic exploration goes back at least a thousand years, to when the northern reaches of Russia we being mapped, and Norse sagas recorded ice conditions around Iceland even further back in time. There aren\u2019t many of these early observations. The economic incentive of whaling changed that, beginning in the 1800s. Whaling ship log entries remarked on ice conditions, and archives have preserved many of those records. In the 1890s, the Danish Meteorological Institute began to compile annual yearbooks of ice observations from ships engaged in Arctic trade and exploration. Militaries began to chart ice conditions by air beginning in the mid 20th century.\n\nThere are enough of these early observations to reconstruct or approximate what Arctic-wide sea-ice extent looked like from 1850 on. These data are available as gridded ice concentration data and in other formats in Gridded Monthly Sea Ice Extent and Concentration, 1850 Onward, Version 2.\n\nSea ice extent is constantly changing; to stay up to speed visit The Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis blog at the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",

The sea level has been steadily rising since 1900 at a rate of 1 to 2.5 millimeters per year. In fact, since 1992 new methods of satellite altimetry using the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite indicate a rate of rise of 3 millimeters per year. The Fourth Assessment Report from the IPCC states that \"there is strong evidence that global sea level gradually rose in the 20th century and is currently rising at an increased rate, after a period of little change between AD 0 and AD 1900. Sea level is projected to rise at an even greater rate in this century. \" - Fourth Assessment Report on Sea Level Rise Sea level can rise by two different mechanisms with respect to climate change. The first is the expansion of the sea water as the oceans warm due to an increasing global temperature. The second mechanism is the melting of ice over land, which then adds water to the ocean. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report predicts that total global-average sea level rise from 1990 - 2100 will be 7 - 15 inches for low emission scenarios and 10 - 23 inches for high emission scenarios.\n\nThere are two Science On a Sphere datasets that demonstrate rising sea levels and show the changes in the Earth's appearance as the sea levels rise. This dataset starts with sea level 150 meters below its present level. The areas that appear white are land that would be uncovered if the sea level was below the current level. The animation proceeds in 10 meter increments, increasing up to 80 meters above the current sea level. Current land masses that would be covered by the rising sea level are shaded black. The National Snow and Ice Data Center predicts that if both Antarctica and Greenland, the world's largest ice sheets, both melted completely, the sea level would rise more than 70 meters. The second dataset, Impact of 6 meter Sea Level Rise (red), shows the sea level rising meter by meter from current sea level up to 6 meters above sea level. The land that would be covered by water is shaded red to show the drastic decrease in land as the waters rise. The same dataset is also available with black shading for land covered by water.",

    "description": "The water in the ocean is constantly moving. Ocean currents are typically driven by surface wind and can have a huge impact on climate. Northwest Europe is moderately temperate considering its latitude because the Gulf Stream off of the eastern coast of the United States transports warm water north to those areas. In fact, the Atlantic Ocean along the U.S. coast is much warmer than the Pacific Ocean along the U.S. coast because of the warm water transported in the Gulf Stream. In this visualization, a model created by NASA, the color variations denote speed. The lighter green areas are moving faster than the blue areas.\n\nAlong most of the coasts, where the water faces an obstacle, the water\u2019s velocity increases and eddies form. Eddies (small whirlpools) are most readily seen in streams, where they form behind rocks as the water flows around them. The eddies in the ocean follow the same priniciple, but are so large that they are hard to detect. Eddies can also spin off at the edges of currents as they travel through the oceans. An almost constant string of eddies is visible off of the northern coast of South America as an equatorial current from Africa crashes into South America. Eddies are also visible off of many islands around the world.",

    "description": "To gather long-term information about the world's oceans and currents, satellite instruments make extremely precise measurements of the height of the ocean surface above the center of the Earth, a measurement commonly called sea level. These data are combined to reveal the ocean surface topography (not to be confused with bathymetry, which is the relief on the bottom of the ocean). Sea surface height is of interest to scientists because it reveals information about how much heat is stored in the ocean. Warm water is less dense than cold water, so higher areas tend to be warmer than lower areas. Radar altimeter instruments onboard spacecraft have been continuously collecting sea surface height data over the global ocean for almost two decades.\n\nThis dataset illustrates the changing height of the ocean surface as seen from space from 1992 - 2008. The data are sea surface height anomalies from blended TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, ERS 1, ERS 2, GFO and Envisat ocean altimetry satellites. An \"anomaly\" is the difference between the long-term average for different regions of the ocean and what is actually 'seen' by the spacecraft. When oceanographers and climatologists view these \"anomalies\" they can identify unusual patterns and see where heat is being stored in the ocean, which will influence future global climate events.\n\nOcean surface topography data have significant practical applications in such areas as weather and climate forecasting, monitoring changes in shorelines, marine operations, and protecting our great ocean fisheries.\n\nFor more information visit: NASA JPL Ocean Surface Topography from Space",

    "description": "As anyone who has been on a boat knows, the ocean surface is not flat. It ripples and undulates due to wind and waves, rises with the tidal pull of the moon, expands and contracts as it heats and cools, and billows due to circulation patterns. Sea surface height anomaly data is able to characterize these small- and large-scale changes over weeks and years. An anomaly is the difference between the long-term average for different regions of the ocean and what is actually observed by satellites.\n\nSince 1992, the Ocean Surface Topography Mission has been taking detailed satellite measurements of the height of the ocean surface for weather, climate, and undersea mapping applications. The latest satellite in the OSTM series is Jason-3, which was launched on January 17, 2016 and uses a microwave altimeter sensor to measure changes in the height of the ocean to an accuracy of 2.5 cm.\n\nMeasuring these differences allows oceanographers and climatologists to detect patterns of global sea level rise, hurricanes, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, eddies, boundary currents. When water warms, it expands and raises the surface of the ocean, so measuring the ocean surface height allows scientists to understand how much heat is stored in the oceans.\n\nThe imagery in this dataset shows whether the ocean surface is higher or lower than the average (the average is calculated from 1992-present). In this dataset, redder areas are higher than average and blue areas are below average. Each frame shows the 10-day average beginning on the date listed.",

    "description": "Processes that took place through Earth's history, such as the weathering of rocks, evaporation of ocean water, and the formation of sea ice, have made the ocean salty. Those are still at work today and are counterbalanced by processes that decrease the salt in the ocean, like freshwater input from rivers, precipitation, and the melting of ice. The result is an ocean surface where the salinity - the concentration of salt - changes and these changes, small as they may be, have large-scale effects on Earth's water cycle and ocean circulation.\n\nLooking down on the oceans from high above, this animation depicts the day-by-day time evolution of sea surface salinities simulated by the NOAA GFDL CM2.6 climate model. One can see the interplay of fresh waters as they seek to exit the Arctic, moving southward along both sides of Greenland until they merge and circulate around the rim of the Labrador Sea. At the same time, higher salinity surface waters flow from the Gulf Stream extension, pass between Iceland and the British Isles, and enter the Nordic Seas. Icebergs are made of fresh frozen water, therefore, where icebergs form, sea surface salinity increases causing the water to increase in density. This high resolution model - the model grid cells are all smaller than 5 km (3.1 miles) on a side in the Arctic region - produces a wealth of eddies, which play a role in transport salt and heat in the ocean.\n\nOcean salinity is measured in PSU (practical salinity unit), grams of salt per 1000 grams of water.\n\nPaper Globe Cutouts are available for this dataset!",

    "description": "Rather than plotting sea surface temperatures, sea surface temperature anomalies have been plotted here to show the dramatic departures from normal that are associated with El Nino and La Nina from 1980 - 1999. El Nino is the warming of the Pacific Ocean off of the western coast of South America near Ecuador and Peru. It is called El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, referring to the Christ child because the phenomena usually occurs near Christmas time. The opposite of El Nino is La Nina, or little girl in Spanish, which is a cooling of the Pacific Ocean. The red shading signifies a warming of the ocean by 5-10\u00b0F, the green shading is normal and the blue shading is a cooling of the ocean by 5-10\u00b0F.\n\nIn strong El Nino years, a prominent red band indicating warmer water extends out into the Pacific Ocean. Observed El Nino years include 1982-1983, 1986-1987, 1991-1992, 1993, 1994, and 1997-1998. The series of El Nino\u2019s in the early 1990\u2019s was unusual because they were spaced so close together, though they were all relatively weak. The most notable El Nino years include 1982-1983, 1986-1987 and 1997-1998. In fact, the 1997-1998 El Nino was so strong that it started to gain national attention. The effects of a strong El Nino include a wetter than normal season in most of the United States, though the Pacific Northwest states tend to be drier. An El Nino affects the weather worldwide. Indonesia and the Philippines, for example, are drier than normal during El Nino and have increased risk of forest fires while East Africa experiences much wetter conditions from March through May. La Nina has the opposite effect as El Nino, causing the United States to be drier than normal. Samples of a strong El Nino and La Nina occurrence are available as additional datasets. In these datasets, the land is true color shaded and a mask has been applied to highlight only the region off of South America.",

    "description": "Sea surface temperature, much like the atmosphere\u2019s temperature, is constantly changing. Water warms up and cools down at a slower rate than air, so diurnal variations (heating during the day and cooling during the night) seen in the atmosphere are hard to observe in the ocean. The seasons, however, can be seen as the warmest water near the equator expands toward the United States during the summer months and withdraws again during the winter months. The interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere is one that scientists are constantly researching, and the temperature of the sea surface is a key factor in those interactions. Sea surface temperature anomaly is the difference between the current temperature and the long-term temperature average. Negative temperature differences indicate that the ocean is cooler than average, while positive temperature difference indicate that the ocean is warmer than average. Tracking sea surface anomalies helps scientists quickly identify areas of warming and cooling, which can effect coral reef ecosystems, hurricane development, and the development of El Nino and La Nina.\n\nThe real-time sea surface temperature dataset is provided by the NOAA Visualization Lab using data from NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch, meaning it is the same data source as other real-time ocean temperature products, such as SST, Coral Degree Heating Weeks and Coral HotSpots. The data combines measurements from all current geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites, including U.S. satellites and those of international partners such as Japan and Europe. Those measurements are then subtracted from the long-term mean SST for that day to create the anomaly. Since the data is at 5 km/pixel resolution, not only can you see large-scale patters such as El Nino-La Nina, but also many smaller features, such as hurricane wakes.\n\nThe entire archive of this imagery, starting in 1981, is available from NOAA View or FTP for download to your SOS computer.\n\nPaper Globe Cutouts are available for this dataset!",

The warmest water, which is shaded red, can be seen expanding from the equator during the summer. The East Coast of the U.S. warms steadily during the summer months and then cools in the fall and winter. Ocean currents are also visible, such as the Gulf Stream, which transports warm Gulf of America water up the East Coast. Along the edges of many of the currents, ocean eddies (small whirlpools) can be seen mixing and dispersing the temperature gradients. Ocean eddies also appear along coasts, where land is an obstacle in the path of the water.",

In addition to seeing the effects of the seasonal cycle, the viewer can see how surface ocean currents and eddies transport heat and water around the globe. The images were generated not from observations, but from a state-of-the-art computer model of Earth's climate created at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL).\n\nThe sea surface temperature (SST) at a particular location is influenced by a number of factors, including the amount of sunlight that reaches the ocean. Because our planet's axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees, the intensity of sunlight that reaches different latitudes varies as the Earth orbits the Sun once a year, leading to the seasons. In this dataset, one can follow the progression of the seasons as the colors representing the warmest and coldest SSTs appear to migrate northward and southward during the course of a year.

By collecting data from multiple satellites, cloud-free composites can be generated on a daily basis because at some point, one of the satellites will get a cloud-free observation of the ocean surface during the 24-hour period. The resolution of the data is 5 km/pixel. At this resolution, features such as the Gulf Stream along the East Coast of the United States are distinguishable.\n\nThe entire archive of this imagery, starting in 1981, is available from NOAA View or FTP for download to your SOS computer.",

    "description": "The Virginia Institute of Marine Science found a sub-adult juvenile loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle stranded off of Deltaville, Virginia along the western Chesapeake Bay in July 2004. The sea turtle, appropriately named Delta for the location where s/he was found stranded, had a broken left flipper and a severe head injury most likely from a collision with a boat propeller. Delta was transferred to the Virginia Aquarium Stranding Program for rehabilitation. After many months of recovery and head surgery, Delta was ready for release in November of 2004. Before release, Delta was outfitted with a satellite tag by Kate Mansfield, then a Ph.D. student at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (College of William and Mary). This was done in order to track Delta's movements and determine the success of the recovery.\n\nOn November 16, 2004, Delta was released off of Ocracoke Island in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The release was successful, with Delta swimming away from the release site normally. This dataset tracks the movement of Delta for the nine months after the release from November 16, 2004 through August 6, 2005. Immediately after release, Delta connected with the Gulf Stream and was transported north off of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Delta then appeared to wander around the Atlantic Ocean before turning back towards the United States. Delta was near Bermuda when the tag stopped transmitting. It is thought that the tag stopped transmitting signals because the battery in the tag ran out.",

Out of this came the Tagging of the Pacific Pelagics Project. Pelagaics are open ocean species such as sea birds and elephant seals. Scientists put satellite tags on animals that collect information about position, ocean temperature, pressure, salinity and more! This allows scientists to better understand the migration patterns and habits of these animals.\n\nThis dataset follows Northern elephant seals and Sooty Shearwater seabirds. Northern elephant seals dive deep, sometimes down to 4,650ft and routinely down to 1,800ft. They spend 10 months a year at sea and return to the same beach a couple of times a year, so they are easy to tag and monitor. Sooty Shearwater seabirds are long distance fliers that may travel 74,000km (46,000miles) in a year, reaching Japan, Alaska and California. This dataset tracks Northern elephant seals and Sooty Shearwater seabirds from January 28, 2005 through February 1, 2006. Pictures of elephant seals are available for use as PIPs (picture in pictures).\n\nSee real-time tracking of the Pacific Pelagics",

    "description": "At 4:30 a.m. on January 17, 1994, the shaking of an earthquake awakened 10 million people in the Los Angeles region of Southern California. The earthquake's epicenter was in Northridge, CA, and it was a magnitude 6.7 shock that proved to be the most costly earthquake in United States history. The shaking heavily damaged communities throughout the San Fernando Valley and Simi Valley, and the surrounding mountains north and west of Los Angeles, causing estimated losses of $20 billion. Fifty-seven people died, more than 9,000 were injured, and more than 20,000 were displaced from their homes by the effects of the quake.\n\nWhen an earthquake occurs, rock is fractured. This fracturing causes nearby rock to move, producing waves that travel through and across the world. There are three main types of seismic waves: P (Primary), S (Secondary), and surface waves. The P-waves are characterized by particle motion in the direction of the wave's propagation. S-waves, on the other hand, produce particle motion at right-angles to the propagation direction. Surface waves, as their name implies, travel over the surface of Earth.\n\nThe dataset includes a PIP that shows what is going on inside Earth as the waves propagate from the point of origin. This origin is called the hypocenter, while the area on the surface of Earth directly above the hypocenter is called the epicenter. The interior of Earth has three regions under the crust: the mantle, the outer core, and the inner core. These regions were discovered through the study of seismic waves, which travel through the interior of Earth and arrive at seismic stations around the world.\n\nS-waves can only travel in a solid, so as an S-wave arrives at the core-mantle boundary, it is reflected back into the mantle as both an S-wave and a P-wave. In addition, some of the energy continues into the outer core as only a P-wave. This is because the outer core is a liquid made of mostly of molten iron. The inner core is also mostly iron, but is solid due to the higher pressures. Therefore, both P-waves and S-waves can propagate through the inner core.",

    "description": "There were more than 30,000 merchant ships greater than 1000 gross tonnage at sea in 2005. The World Meteorological Organization has a Voluntary Observing Ships Scheme that equips ships with weather instruments in order to provide observations for weather models and forecasters. In addition to observing the weather, the location of the ships is also recorded through GPS. From October 2004 through October of 2005 1,189,127 mobile ship data points were collected from 3,374 commercial and research vessels, which is about 11% of all ships at sea in 2005. By connecting the data points for each vessel, shipping routes over the course of one year were plotted. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis compiled this data to include in their Global Map of Human Impacts to Marine Ecosystems.\n\nAs seen in this dataset, there are several very popular shipping routes around the world. The density of ship tracks in any location ranges from 0 to 1,158 on this map, showing relative density (in color) against a black background with scale of 1 km. Some of the most populated shipping routes cross through the Panama Canal, the Suez Canal, the Strait of Malacca , and the Strait of Gibraltar. Because only 11% of ships are represented in this dataset, the density of ship traffic is not fully portrayed and is biased to the types of ships that volunteered for the program. The map creators suggest that the high traffic locations may be strongly underestimated. In spite of this, there are enough data points to highlight some of the busiest shipping routes. There is also a version of this dataset with the major canals and straits labeled.",

    "description": "This dataset gives us a glimpse of what has recently been and what is soon to come. That is, twenty years of solar eclipse paths from 2010 - 2030. Blue represents the annular eclipse paths and red represents the total eclipse paths.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, there are two that cross America. First, an annular eclipse on October 14, 2023 from Oregon through parts of Nevada, Utah, New Mexico and Texas. Second, a total eclipse on April 8, 2024 that makes a big path across a populated chunk of the United States. Cities in totality include (but are not limited to): San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Dayton and Cleveland, Ohio; Buffalo, Syracuse and Rochester, New York; Burlington, Vermont; and Montreal, Canada.\n\nSolar eclipses are magnificent to see and happen somewhat regularly, though they rarely cross the same location. Focusing on total solar eclipses, there are roughly two in a three-year period on Earth, but the shadow of totality often is only about fifty miles wide. The average number of years between a place on Earth having two total solar eclipses is once in every four hundred years! That is just an average, however, and two can occur in the same place over a short period of time too.\n\nEclipses are very predictable as they follow a cycle that takes place over 6,585 days. This cycle is known as the Saros cycle. Every 18 years, 11 days, and 8 hours, a similar eclipse path arises as the Sun, Earth, and Moon are relatively in the same geometry, but shifted over 120 degrees in longitude on Earth. Thanks to the cycle, we know that the path the 2023 Annular Eclipse will follow (Saros 134) will repeat on October 25, 2041, just over China and Japan. You can see the cycle pretty clearly when looking at the annular (blue) eclipse on January, 15, 2010 starting in Africa and moving through Asia, as well as the one that will occur in South America and Europe on January 26, 2028.\n\nAnnular eclipses are not quite total, which means that there is a bit of the sun peeking out from the sides. Still, they are magnificent and should be celebrated!\n\nEclipse paths were pulled from the ArcGIS Hub and then filtered and formatted using ArcGIS Pro.",

    "description": "A total solar eclipse happens when the disk of the moon appears to completely cover the disk of the sun in the sky as it passes between earth and the sun and can only happen during a new moon. The last time a total solar eclipse was seen from anywhere in the continental United States (CONUS), however, was 1979.\n\nDaylight turns into twilight and the temperature drops rapidly revealing large delicate streamers of light (the solar corona) streaking out from the silhouette of the moon. A total solar eclipse is a natural phenomenon, nevertheless, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses have been attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who are unaware of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear during the day and the sky darkens in a matter of minutes. The approach the moon's inner shadow projecting on the atmosphere can look like an approaching storm, and an eerie orange twilight color rings the horizon during the total phase.\n\nIf the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every month. However, the Moon's orbit is inclined (tilted) at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so its shadow at new moon usually misses Earth. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's inner shadow or umbra.\n\nSince looking directly at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the unaided eye and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse. The partial phase can span 2-3 hours while the total phase can only last up to 7.5 minutes for any one location. In order to see the most impressive experience, the location for which you choose to view the eclipse should be clear and sunny. NOAA's cloudiness map may improve your experience!\n\nTotality for the August 21, 2017 eclipse can be seen within about a 70 mile wide path from portions of the following U.S. States: Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and South Carolina. Maximum duration for this total eclipse is 2 minutes 40 seconds. The partial phases last almost 3 hours. This dataset shows the motion of the Moon's shadow on the Earth depicting the relative darkness of the inner shadow, called the umbra where the eclipse is total, and the outer penumbra where the eclipse is partial.

    "description": "The sun is crucial for life on our planet. It never ceases to amaze us with events such as eclipses or space weather. And who watches the sun for changes? NOAA. In this video we take a deep dive into what is called Space Weather \u2013 what it is, what causes it, and why we keep an eye on the sun.\n\nOur star is a gigantic ball of extremely heated gas that constantly releases energy and mass and periodically produces explosions on its surface, which affect the environment in space around our planet and causes space weather. There are several phenomena occurring on the sun that have a chance to affect our planet in different ways, both good and bad. From creating amazing green and purple lights in the night sky \u2013 Auroras \u2013 to generating problems with telecommunications, astronaut safety, and our power grid.\n\nThe Space Weather Prediction Center, one of nine National Centers for Environmental Prediction at NOAA, keeps an eye on the sun 24/7. If an event on the sun threatens to impact our planet, NOAA is responsible for issuing communicating alerts, just like the National Weather Service does with hurricanes or tornadoes. Alongside NASA, NOAA studies the sun to better predict when these events might happen in order to improve our early warning capabilities.\n\nFor more information about space weather visit NOAA\u2019s SPWC webpage. You can also find amazing sun imagery and visualization at NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio.\n\nSome images, videos, and music were licensed from Getty Images. Several visualizations were provided by NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio. The video was edited using a free open source video editing software Shotcut. Python code was used to make rotating videos from static videos or stills and to process sun imagery (*.fits) to images (*.png).",

Knowing how much of the Sun's energy reaches the surface helps scientists understand weather and climate patterns as well as patterns of plant growth around our world. Solar insolation maps are also useful to engineers who design solar panels and batteries designed to convert energy from the Sun into electricity to power appliances in our homes and work places.\n\nThis data came from the Earth Observations and specifically from the CERES (clouds and Earth Radiant Energy Systems)instrument onboard the NASA TRMM satellite (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission).",

    "description": "The sun is an incredible source of energy. This dataset visualizes the potential for us our to tap into that energy for human use. What is shown is a location's ability to generate electricity from sunlight using photovoltaic technology, which is called photovoltaic (PV) power potential as an average for each month of the year. This potential depends on many factors. Sunnier locations naturally have a greater potential for power. The climate also matters. It turns out that photovoltaic panels used to collect the energy from the sun tend to perform better in cooler temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the overall climate, including temperature and weather patterns, plays a significant role in determining a location's suitability for PV energy generation. Also, geographical features and the efficiency of the PV technology used are essential. Factors like latitude, terrain, altitude above sea level, and land orientation can influence the amount of sunlight received. Additionally, advancements in PV panel technology can greatly enhance the conversion rate of sunlight to electricity. All these aspects combined determine the optimal planning and installation of solar panels to maximize energy production in a given area.\n\nSomething important to note is the apparent missing data close to the poles, specifically beyond the polar circles. These circles represent important geographical boundaries related to the Earth's tilt and orbit around the Sun. They mark the points beyond which, for at least one day each year, there is at least one 24-hour period when the sun does not set (during the summer solstice) and at least one 24-hour period when the sun does not rise (during the winter solstice). Thus the use of solar energy beyond the polar circles becomes less and less practical.\n\nThe present dataset was developed based on the Global Solar Atlas, initiated by the World Bank Group and developed with key inputs from Solargis. It presents a detailed analysis of different variables related to the solar power potential worldwide. This atlas offers a thorough examination of solar irradiance and photovoltaic power potential across diverse geographic regions. The present dataset was developed based on this resource.\n\nIn essence, the Global Solar Atlas serves as a practical guide for leveraging solar energy wisely, aiding in strategic decision-making for optimal solar panel placement and energy production across different locations.\n\nThe dataset contains individual monthly layers created based on ESRI\u2019s Living Atlas layers.They were processed using ArcGIS Pro (for a free alternative use QGis) and exported in the appropriate SOS input format (png file format with a 2:1 aspect ratio using an equatorial cylindrical projection).

    "title": "Solar Synoptic Map Building",
    "description": "A synoptic map shows a large portion of the surface of the Sun. From an observatory on Earth or in Earth orbit we can see only one side of the Sun at any one time. The Sun rotates fully about every 27 days, so over time we can see the whole surface. To make a synoptic map, over 100 images of the Sun are taken at six-hour intervals during the course of one rotation. Longitudinal strips are taken from the center of each image and placed side-by-side in sequence to create a composite image that shows almost the entire Sun.\n\nThe surface of the Sun is dynamic. From one period of six hours to the next the Sun changes only a little, so the transition between consecutive strips appears very smooth. However, the time difference between the first and last strip is more than 27 days, during which noticeable changes occur. This causes a visible discontinuity where the two ends of the map come together. The fact that the surface of the Sun rotates at slightly different rates at different latitudes adds to this discontinuity.\n\nThe north and south poles of the Sun are not well represented in this kind of map. Furthermore, due to a 7 degree tilt of Earth's orbit with respect to the Sun\u2019s rotational axis, one of the Sun's poles is often not seen at all during a rotation.\n\nThe synoptic map on SOS shows the Sun from 10/1/2023 to 10/27/2023. The images are from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics observatory (SDO) which is in a geosynchronous Earth orbit. The images are made using ultraviolet light (30.4nm wavelength) which shows activity and detail in the solar chromosphere.\n\nLength of dataset: 0:36",

    "description": "It's often hard to fully grasp just how big the planets in the solar system are. 1.3 million Earths could fit in the Sun, but that is hard to picture. A good way to help with this problem is drawing the planets to scale. This dataset has the Sun as the background and then has a picture of the solar system drawn to scale. The Sun is also to scale with the rest of the planets. By far, Jupiter is the largest planet with Saturn the second largest, but they are certainly no where close to being as big as the Sun, which has a radius of 432,000 miles (695,000 km). Now that Pluto is no longer classified as a planet, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is the smallest planet with a radius of 1516 miles (2440 km). The second planet in the solar system, Venus, is the third smallest planet with a radius of 3761 miles (6052 km). Earth, of course, is the third closest planet to the Sun and the fourth smallest with a radius of 3963 miles (6378 km). Just past Earth is Mars, the fourth planet in the solar system. Mars is the second smallest planet with a radius of 2111 miles (3397 km). The first four planets are called terrestrial planets because they are made mainly of rock and have thin wispy atmospheres.\n\nThe outer planets are called gas giants because they are large and consist mainly of hydrogen and helium. The gas giants also typically have a large number of moons, while the terrestrial planets have limited moons. The first gas giant, Jupiter, is certainly a giant. The radius of Jupiter is 44,423 miles (71492 km). More than 1300 Earth's could fit inside Jupiter. The next planet past Jupiter is Saturn, the second largest planet. The radius of Saturn is 37,449 miles (60268 km). The rings of Saturn would be the width of a credit card and would extend much further than the picture shows. The edge of the brightest rings extends 75,900 miles (122,200 km) from Saturn and the faintest rings extend out 300,000 miles (483,000 km) from Saturn. The seventh planet from the sun is Uranus. Uranus ranks as the third largest planet with a radius of 15882 miles (25,559 km). Now considered the eighth and final planet in the solar system is Neptune, the fourth largest planet with a radius of 15,389 miles (24,766 km). Uranus and Neptune are very close in size. The final object in the picture is Pluto, which is now classified as a dwarf planet. Pluto only has a radius of 715 miles (1150 km). It was demoted from planet to dwarf planet in 2006 when new guidelines were created to classify planets and Pluto didn't meet all of the qualifications.",

But over centuries, lands rise and sink, continents move and the balance of the ocean shifts. These changes are tracked through the science of geodesy, dedicated to measuring and precisely charting the size and shape of Earth. Geodesy began more than 2,000 years ago, when a clever human named Eratosthenes discovered that you could measure the circumference of the Earth by looking down a well. Over time, the field of geodesy has expanded and evolved dramatically. In modern geodesy, scientists use multiple techniques to map the world's ice sheets, watch sea level creep up and monitor the impact of earthquakes, droughts and floods. This animated video looks at the long history of geodesy and highlights some of the technologies NASA uses, such as radio telescopes and long-range lasers, to take the basic measure of our planet.",

More than 20,000 of these are larger than a softball.\n\nSpace debris, junk, trash is the collection of defunct man-made objects in space like old satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments from disintegration, erosion, and collisions. They all travel at speeds up to 17,500 mph, fast enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft, which is a dramatic potential danger to all space vehicles, especially to those that are manned spacecrafts like the International Space Station.\n\nThe greatest risk to space missions comes from non-trackable debris, said Nicholas Johnson, NASA chief scientist for orbital debris. Claiming that space shuttle windows have been replaced because of damage caused by material that was analyzed and shown to be paint flecks. It's a wonder, with so much orbital debris, there have been only a few disastrous collisions.\n\nIn 1957 after the beginning of the space race (started by the launch of Sputnik),the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) started compiling a database of all known debris. The Department of Defense maintains a highly accurate satellite catalog on objects in Earth orbit that are larger than a softball. NASA and the DoD cooperate and share responsibilities for characterizing the satellite (including orbital debris) environment.",

Roughly 41% of amphibians are classified as threatened with a high risk of extinction. Amphibians are more extreme than the other vertebrate groups in that many of them are restricted to very small distributions, sometimes only a few square miles. As a result, even though nearly half of the world\u2019s amphibians are shown in this map, they occur in just a tiny fraction of the land surface. These are the places where conservation is urgently needed to save these amphibians from extinction.",

    "description": "The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory is a spacecraft that was launched in 1995 as part of a collaboration between NASA and ESA (the European Space Agency). The goal of the SOHO project is to study the Sun from its deep core to the outer corona and solar wind. This is important because solar storms can affect everyday life on Earth. The sun goes through an eleven year cycle of active and non-active periods. One of the useful tools on board SOHO is the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope, EIT. The EIT can image active regions, solar flares, filaments and prominences, coronal holes, coronal \"bright points,\" polar plumes, and a variety of other solar features. There are currently two SOHO datasets. Because SOHO only takes a picture of the visible side of the Sun, it does not provide full coverage of the Sun. This dataset is the result of NASA scientists trying to make up for this lack of full coverage. Scientists took 30 day composites of SOHO data for 6 years and cropped the images so that only the very center 5\u00b0 of the maps remained. Then the cropped maps were spliced together to provide full coverage.\n\nThe second dataset, Solar and Heliosphere Observation (SOHO) Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope October 2003 is the compilation of EIT images from October 2003, a very active month for the Sun. A solar flare is an explosion on the Sun that occurs when energy stored in twisted magnetic fields (usually associated with sunspots) is suddenly released. This explosion sends radiation, from radio waves to x-rays and gamma-rays, out into space. It is this radiation that can have an effect on Earth. The solar storms are classified based on their x-ray brightness. There are 3 classifications: X-class flares are the biggest and most damaging, M-class flares are medium and can cause brief radio blackouts in the polar regions, and C-class flares are the smallest and have few noticeable consequences on Earth. Within each classification, there are subcategories to further classify the storms. Solar flares can cause Coronal Mass Ejections, CME, which are outflows of plasma from the sun that can cause geomagnetic storms on Earth. On October 28, 2003 an X17.2 flare was observed, the second largest storm observed by SOHO. This storm set off a strong CME which hit Earth on October 29. Then on the afternoon of the 29th, a X10 solar flare set off another CME. Several of the SOHO instruments had to be shut down during this time. These two events can be clearly seen in this dataset as a bright flash followed by the appearance of \"snow\"",

    "description": "The sun is often most interesting to observe at Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) wavelengths rather than visible wavelengths. In the EUV, the sunspots and active regions are bright instead of dark and the solar magnetic field can be observed as loops around the active region. Solar physicists and space weather forecasters watch the sun with special EUV cameras mounted on satellites. One such satellite, the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), carries the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly which images the solar atmosphere in multiple EUV wavelengths. By imaging the sun at a resolution of about 1 arcsecond and at a cadence of 10 seconds, this instrument is designed to provide an unprecedented view of the part of the solar atmosphere called the corona. At this resolution, each AIA image contains 2048 x 2048 pixels or 17 Megapixels. The primary goal of the AIA Science Investigation is to use these data to significantly improve our understanding of the physics behind the activity displayed by the Sun's atmosphere, which drives space weather.\n\nThis sequence shows the helium 30.4 nm channel which highlights the active network and filaments on the sun. Five days of data were collected from 5-9 September 2011 at a 2.5 minute cadence. These images were stretched and modified to create a more realistic display for the SOS format. It should be noted that the SDO imagers can only see one side of the sun so it is impossible to know what is going on around on the back side. In order to create a full 360 sequence of images, the central part of the sun, where the resolution is the best, was repeated three times to create the appearance of the full sun. You can see that the bright active region appears three times and there is a region where each image overlaps its neighbor creating a slight blurring of the image.\n\nDuring this sequence, there are several things to look for. First, the active network of the sun is constantly boiling and churning. Then there are long dark thread-like features call filament channels. There are the bright active regions with complex magnetic loops that shift and change. And then throughout this sequence, there are a number of solar flares that erupt from the brightest active region. You have to watch carefully to see them. When the flare erupts, the magnetic loops around the flare rearrange and change. And a blast wave expands across the surface of the sun emanating from the flare.\n\nSolar flares often initiate a sequence of events called Space Weather. The solar flare itself can impact radio communication at Earth. The flare can initiate a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) which travels at several million km per hour and, if it hits Earth, can create a lot of problems for satellites, airlines, electric power lines, and GPS. The CME can create a geomagnetic storm that produces aurora.\n\nThis sequence was created by undergraduate students in the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates program in cooperation with NASA and the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center.",

There are 3 classifications: X-class flares are the biggest and most damaging, M-class flares are medium and can cause brief radio blackouts in the polar regions, and C-class flares are the smallest and have few noticeable consequences on Earth. Within each classification, there are subcategories to further classify the storms. Solar flares can cause Coronal Mass Ejections, CME, which are outflows of plasma from the sun that can cause geomagnetic storms on Earth. On October 28, 2003 an X17.2 flare was observed, the second largest storm observed by SOHO. This storm set off a strong CME which hit Earth on October 29. Then on the afternoon of the 29th, a X10 solar flare set off another CME. Several of the SOHO instruments had to be shut down during this time. These two events can be clearly seen in this dataset as a bright flash followed by the appearance of \"snow\"",

    "description": "The sun is often most interesting to observe at Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) wavelengths rather than visible wavelengths. In the EUV, the sunspots and active regions are bright instead of dark and the solar magnetic field can be observed as loops around the active region. Solar physicists and space weather forecasters watch the sun with special EUV cameras mounted on satellites. One such satellite, the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), carries the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly which images the solar atmosphere in multiple EUV wavelengths. By imaging the sun at a resolution of about 1 arcsecond and at a cadence of 10 seconds, this instrument is designed to provide an unprecedented view of the part of the solar atmosphere called the corona. The primary goal of the AIA Science Investigation is to use these data to significantly improve our understanding of the physics behind the activity displayed by the Sun's atmosphere, which drives space weather.\n\nThis sequence shows the sun as seen in the 19.3 nm channel of AIA. This wavelength highlights the active regions on the sun and the magnetic structures associated with them. Five days of data were collected from 5-9 September 2011 at a 2.5 minute cadence. These images were stretched and modified to create a more realistic display for the SOS format. It should be noted that the SDO imagers can only see one side of the sun so it is impossible to know what is going on around on the back side. In order to create a full 360 sequence of images, the central part of the sun, where the resolution is the best, was repeated three times to create the appearance of the full sun. You can see that the bright active region appears three times and there is a region where each image overlaps its neighbor creating a slight blurring of the image.",

    "description": "The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, STEREO, which consists of two satellites, was launched in October 2006. The two satellites are on a path similar to Earth's orbit, with one satellite ahead of Earth and one satellite behind Earth in orbit. The satellites, named STEREO Ahead and STEREO Behind, are slowly drifting further a part, keeping Earth between them. As they drift further from the Earth, they are able to provide a view of the sun that cannot be seen from Earth. The satellites passed 180 degrees of separation on Feb 6, 2011, providing a view of the far side of the sun for the first time. The two STEREO spacecraft provide a stereoscopic view of the Sun and its atmosphere, similar to the way our two eyes allow us to see the three-dimensional world around us. Being in permanent orbit about the Sun, the pair will continue their migration, and will cross behind the sun in 2015. Since passing the 180 degree mark, the STEREO mission now has a growing blind spot on the earthward view of the sun. To complete these observations, the maps also include data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) taken at the same time and wavelength band. SDO was launched in February 2010, and has been providing nearly continuous images of the Sun since June 2010.\n\nThere are two STEREO/SDO datasets for Science On a Sphere, both from the extreme ultraviolet wavelength, which the human eye cannot see directly. In order to keep all of the various wavelengths straight, scientists color the different wavelengths. The 195A wavelength is arbitrarily colored green, while orange was selected for the 304A wavelength. The 195A wavelength is able to detect ionized iron at about 1.5 million degrees C and the 304 A wavelength detects ionized helium at about 60,000 degrees C. The brighter areas in both images show greater intensity of the material and this is where magnetic forces are the strongest. In normal filtered light, these areas would often appear as sunspots. It is in these bright, active regions where solar storms are likely to originate. In these areas, hot plasma from the sun is trapped in the sun's magnetic field. A solar flare is an explosion that occurs when the energy trapped in the magnetic field is suddenly released. Solar flares are often associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) which are outflows of plasma from the sun that can cause geomagnetic storms on Earth. CMEs can occur and often do without a solar flare as well. The dark areas that can be seen are called coronal holes, and are areas where the plasma is able to escape because the magnetic field is open. These real-time datasets are updated daily with a five day data lag. There is one image for every ten minutes.",

    "description": "This X-Ray movie of the sun, produced by Dr. Steven Hill of NOAA\u2019s Space Environment Center, is from October 19, 2003 through November 4, 2003. The data for it is from GOES Solar X-Ray Imager, SXI, which is an instrument attached to the GOES 12 satellite. The Space Environment Center receives a stream of the data which it then uses to make space weather alerts and forecast services. The SXI collects one image per minute and varies the exposure settings to allow for three different views to see coronal structures, active regions and solar flares.\n\nThe corona is the outermost layer of the sun. The dark regions near the poles are coronal holes. These are areas where the sun\u2019s magnetic field extends into space allowing the hot gas to escape, so those areas are cooler, explaining the darker color. The lightest features on here are solar flares which are violent explosions on the surface of the sun. Solar flares can emit radiation which interferes with satellites near Earth. The origin of solar flares is usually near sunspots. Another notable feature on the surface of the sun is the rotation pattern. The sun does not rotate uniformly; the equator rotates faster than the poles and even those speeds vary some. This erratic rotation pattern provides a good idea of the gassy composition of the sun.",

The larger seasonal variation in average temperature of the northern hemisphere relative to the southern hemisphere, a result of the larger land area in the northern hemisphere, is also evident.\n\nLand surface temperature data are from the MODIS sensor on NASA's Terra satellite while the sea surface temperatures (SST) are from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. Both source datasets are monthly composite averages used to minimize holes in the daily data created by cloud cover.

    "description": "This animation shows annual average temperature anomalies (departure from normal) over the globe for the past 1,500 years compared to the average temperature (normal) from 1961-1990. This data collected from over 1,000 paleoclimate proxies. Areas shaded red are warmer than normal while areas shaded blue are cooler than normal.\n\nIt's widely understood that global temperatures varied significantly over the last 1,500 years, but much remains to be understood regarding the spatial patterns of variability. For example, during the Medieval period some specific regions were even warmer than we\u2019ve seen over the last decade, but globally the temperatures were cooler. The Medieval period (defined as 950-1250 C.E.) had a tendency for La Nina-like conditions in the tropical Pacific. The coldest temperatures were during the Little Ice Age, observed between 1400 - 1700 C.E., with greatest cooling over the Northern Hemisphere continents outside the tropics.\n\nIn this paleo-temperature analysis, the authors used a global climate proxy network to reconstruct surface temperature patterns over this time interval. The values that went into this animation were decadally-smoothed and indicate changes at that time-scale and over longer time periods, rather than year-by-year variations. The grey-masked regions represent areas where insufficient instrumental data existed to allow spatially-explicit calibration in the reconstruction process.\n\nThe data from this study are available at from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), World Data Service for Paleoclimatology.

    "description": "These maps from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) show how temperatures have changed worldwide compared to a 1951-1980 baseline. Instead of absolute temperatures, they display anomalies\u2014regions that have warmed or cooled relative to the past.\n\nNASA analyzes data from 6,300 land-based weather stations, satellites, and Antarctic research stations to track temperature changes. The 1951-1980 period includes natural climate patterns like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, ensuring comparisons account for typical variations.\n\nShades of red and orange indicate areas that are warmer than the historical average, while blue areas are cooler. By studying these trends, scientists can better understand climate change and how greenhouse gases influence Earth's temperature.",

    "description": "This animation shows Earth's surface temperature from 1850 through present compared to the 20th century average. Maps are based on data from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center. In 2023, the combined land and ocean surface temperature was 2.12\u00b0F (1.18\u00b0C) above the 20th century average, making the year the warmest since records began in 1850.\n\nBy averaging data over long time spans, typically 30 years or more, climatology datasets are developed. These datasets serve as reference points for comparing points in time to what would be expected. For example, is the temperature warmer or cooler this month than what would be expected from the historical average? Temperature climatologies are extremely important as measurements, models, and reconstructions of Earth's temperature changes are analyzed.\n\nThe Merged Land-Ocean Surface Temperature Analysis from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) uses data from thousands of land and ocean temperature stations worldwide to compute global temperature averages and anomalies. This dataset shows the yearly temperature anomaly from 1850 through present. An anomaly indicates the difference from normal. In this case, normal is the 20th century global average temperature. Blue areas are cooler than the average, red areas are warmer.\n\nFor more information on NCEI's temperature climate analysis, visit the NCEI Climate Monitoring page.",

    "description": "Tethys is thought to be composed almost entirely of water-ice because of its incredibly low density. But the moon was not always solid ice. Many of the surface features of Tethys can be explained by a liquid body turning to ice. Dominating the planet is a huge valley name Ithaca Chasma, which is over 60 miles wide, in excess of 3 miles deep in places and 1240 miles long. This valley runs 3/4 of the way around Tethys\u2019 circumference. Scientists believe that this valley was created as the moon began to freeze. It is thought that the outer shell froze first, and when the core froze and expanded, the crust had to crack due to the expansion, creating the Ithaca Chasma.\n\nAnother feature on Tethys, Odysseus, points to that fact that at one point the moon was not completely solid. Odysseus, is an impact crater with a diameter that is nearly 2/5 of Tethys\u2019 diameter. Had the moon been solid ice during the collision that caused this crater, it is likely that Tethys would have shattered into pieces. The crater is also relatively smooth, lacking the ridge around the edge and a mountain in the center as seen in most large craters. Other than Odysseus, the surface is fairly smooth with only smaller craters dotting the landscape, suggesting that the moon\u2019s surface is young.",

The first part of the film highlights dramatic changes to our land, oceans and atmosphere from human activity over the last 200 years. The second part argues that we are capable of meeting the challenges - we are the best-educated, wealthiest, best-connected cohort of humans who have ever lived. As Chris Paola says in the film, \"It's an amazing time. A time of great change, a time of great peril, perhaps, but it's also a time of great possibility.\"\n\nThe Human Era is one in a series of four SOS films that use data visualizations and actual scientists to tell stories about the impacts of climate change. No other single natural factor affects Earth as much as humans now do. Separately, each film stands alone, focusing on a single area of human impact, and features a researcher working in this area. Together, the films tell a bigger story about the human-generated effects of global climate change.\n\nThis movie is available in English and Spanish.\n\nLength of dataset: 3:36",

Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, and the only moon with a substantial atmosphere. It has fascinating similarities and important differences to that of the Earth. Other natural processes active on Titan include rainfall, rivers and lakes - the only place other than Earth where these can be found - but the liquids on Titan are hydrocarbons similar to gasoline, not water as on Earth.\n\nThe movie takes the viewer on a fictional vacation to Titan, where the traveler first meets the captain of our cruise liner for an introduction, and then tour guides at five different locations on the moon. At each stop, the guides introduce the local geography: a dry lake bed, a dune field, a volcano, a crater and a lake, and then offer a recreational activity such as skiing, driving, ballooning or boating to more vividly illustrate the location and create a memorable learning opportunity. This video was produced by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, with volunteer performances by student summer interns.",

The five main satellites, in order of proximity to Uranus, are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Before the Voyager 2 studied Uranus in 1986, these five moons were the only ones known to exist.\n\nTitania (Queen of the fairies in A Midsummer Night's Dream by Shakespeare) has a surface remarkably similar to that of Ariel. Covered in craters and interconnected valleys like Ariel, Titania is 35% larger than Ariel and is the largest of the known satellites orbiting Uranus. One of the most notable features is a trench that extends for over 1000 miles. It is thought that the satellite was once hot and the valleys and trenches are the result of the planet freezing and expanding.",

    "description": "This planet Earth visualization shows a rotating planet in order to display both a nighttime and daytime view. The daytime side of the visualization shows the bathymetry and topography of the globe. Color coding is used to distinguish between the elevations. Red and gray represent the highest terrain on the land, green and yellow represent the lowest. In the ocean, the darker colors are the deeper ocean floors while the lighter colors indicate shallower areas as well as mountain ranges on the sea floor. The very light blue shading in the ocean, near the land forms, is generally the shallow continental shelf. Some interesting features that can be seen are the mountain ranges in the oceans, such as the mid-Atlantic Ridge in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which is spreading. Also in the ocean is the Marianas Trench, which is south of Japan. This trench is the deepest location in the ocean with an amazing depth of 36,201 feet, almost 7 miles. On land, the Himalayas are a noteworthy feature, as they are the home of Mount Everest, the tallest point on earth at a height of 29,035 feet, almost 5.5 miles.\n\nThe nighttime side of this visualization shows lights of the world over a one-year period. The white represents lights generated from electricity, the orange shading shows fires, the green shading indicates light from squid fishing boats, and the blue spots are gas flares from oil rigs. Areas of high population and economic development are generally covered with white lights. Also, areas along coasts tend to be well populated. The Nile River can be easily traced from the string of lights that outline it. Major interstates in the United States can be traced out from the lights of the towns along the roads. The fishing lights are most dense near Japan. Fishermen shine bright lights into the seas to attract squid to the surface in order to catch them. The orange shading might make it seem that large portions of Africa are on fire. However, this shading depicts a composite of one year\u2019s worth of data so the fires are not all burning at once. While some of the fires are for cooking and light, most are the result of slash and burn agriculture in the jungles.",

    "title": "Triton: Neptune's Moon",
    "description": "Triton is the biggest of Neptune\u2019s thirteen known moons. This moon is suspected to have been captured by Neptune, which would explain its highly unusual orbit and rotation. One of the only bodies in the solar system to have a retrograde orbit, Triton also rotates at an angle of 157\u00b0 to the axis of Neptune\u2019s rotation. This means that the poles and equator alternately face the sun during rotation, most likely causing dramatic changes in seasons. When the Voyager 2 flew by in 1989, Triton\u2019s South Pole was facing the sun. An ice cap of frozen nitrogen and methane was found on Triton\u2019s South Pole when Voyager 2 visited.\n\nThere are extensive systems of ridges and valleys covering the young, relatively crater-free surface of Triton. This is thought to be the result of freezing and thawing cycles. Triton\u2019s temperature, similar to that of Pluto, is -391\u00b0F. At this temperature, methane, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide all freeze solid. One reason for this incredibly cold temperature is the high albedo of the moon. With an albedo of .7-.8, most of the scarce sunlight that makes it to the surface of Triton is reflected. Probably the most interesting feature on Triton is the active ice volcanoes that were observed by the Voyager 2. One of the plumes was measured to be over five miles high. The volcanoes are thought to be caused by liquid nitrogen, dust or methane compounds from the center of the moon. It has also been discovered that Triton has a very thin atmosphere that is growing warmer for reasons unknown to scientists.",

    "title": "Tropical Widening",
    "description": "This dataset was developed as part of the EarthNow project, and shows the changes in the tropical zone boundaries over the last three decades.\n\nThe tropics are defined by a number of different factors including latitude, precipitation, and wind. The easterly winds are one way to define the tropics and the global atmospheric circulations that influence those winds also influence the concentration of total column ozone. In this dataset, the easterly winds and are indicated in orange. They are the central belt of the world that is traditionally defined by a warm moist climate. In order to define the boundary of the tropics, satellites are used to measure the total column ozone differences between the tropics and the subtropics. The highest levels of ozone are found in the stratosphere, the second layer of the atmosphere. In the tropics, the tropopause, the boundary between the first two layers of the atmosphere, is higher causing the stratosphere to be thinner and therefore less ozone is found in the total column. Ozone is produced in the tropics by convective weather and abundant sunlight (the energy that is required to split O2 molecules to form ozone, O3) and transported to the polar regions, where it pools and sinks as the tropopause falls to a lower altitude.\n\nThe total column of ozone measurement is compared to past measurements and used to define the changing tropical boundary. In the past 30 years the boundary of the tropics has shifted on average 10 degrees latitude. The blue line is the tropical boundary of 1980-1984 while the red line in the boundary of 2008-2012.\n\nThis expansion is significant, as it spreads the threat of tropical diseases as well as drought areas within the subtropics. This is even more important as this region of the world is home to most of the Earth's human inhabitants. Due to this shift, increased drought is forecasted for much of the world including southwestern United States, the Middle East, and southern Australia. These changes will also spread tropical diseases such as dengue fever and others, as there have been recent outbreaks in Florida, Portugal, and Russia. Understanding these changes in climate boundaries will offer great insight into the best ways to face these new conditions including vaccinations, food production, and urban development.",

The narrated production uses global datasets, graphics and animations to describe the 2004 event and to take viewers through a future tsunami scenario originating off the US west coast.\n\nNOAA and the NTHMP collaborated to create \"Tsunami\" with input from a broad team of tsunami and communication experts, including scientists working in research and operations, coastal emergency managers, information technology specialists, and civil defense planners. The NTHMP is a joint program between NOAA and other Federal agencies, U.S. coastal States and U.S. Territories that works to prepare for and educate coastal communities about tsunamis. NOAA's Environmental Visualization Laboratory and Film studio provided visualization, animation and production expertise. For simplicity, the two NOAA Tsunami Warning Centers with their distinct areas of responsibility are represented as one Center located in Alaska.\n\nLength of dataset: 7:55",

    "description": "The 6+ miles wide asteroid that hit Earth 66 million years ago, widely accepted to have wiped out nearly all the dinosaurs and roughly three-quarters of the planet\u2019s plant and animal species, also triggered a megatsunami with mile-high waves. Recent historical tsunamis pale in comparison with this globally catastrophic event, thought to be 30,000 times more initial energy than any recorded events.\n\nIn this dataset, the black continents depict the land masses at the time of the impact, around 66 million years ago. The white country borders show where the land masses are today \u2014 moving at approximately 2.5 cm (1 inch) per year, the continents are constantly drifting. The animation shows tsunami wave amplitude 10 minutes after impact until 48 hours after impact, shown in hours below the scale. After the first 48 hours, the tsunami had mostly subsided except near the point of impact. The colors on the tsunami animation are associated with both positive (red) and negative (blue) wave amplitudes, highlighting how the ocean ripples with both higher and lower water levels in the ocean basins during a catastrophic tsunami.\n\nNote that even though the color bar numerical values top out at +/- 5 meters, the wave amplitudes were much more extreme in some places. Two and a half minutes after the asteroid struck, a curtain of ejected material pushed a wall of water outward from the impact site, briefly forming a 4.5 kilometers high (2.8 miles) wave that subsided as the ejecta fell back to Earth. Ten minutes after the projectile hit the Yucatan, and 220 kilometers (137 miles) from the point of impact, a 1.5 kilometers high (0.93 miles) tsunami wave\u2014ring-shaped and outward-propagating\u2014began sweeping across the ocean in all directions, according to the U-M simulation.\n\nAn international group of researchers from academic institutions and government agencies, including NOAA\u2019s Pacific Marine Environmental Lab and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab, combined numerical modeling and analysis of geological records to recreate the global impact of the tsunami generated by the asteroid. This dataset presents the first global simulation of the Chicxulub asteroid impact tsunami.\n\nNumerical analysis of the event used three different models to reproduce tsunami generation and propagation. A large computer program that models details of complex fluid flows, called a hydrocode, simulated the first 10 minutes of the tsunami generation, and two NOAA-developed models were then used to simulate the tsunami propagation around the global ocean. Additionally, the research team reviewed the geological record at more than 100 sites worldwide and found evidence that supports the models\u2019 predictions of the tsunami\u2019s path and power \u2014 a remarkable verification of the model for the megatsunami event of 66 million years ago.\n\nThis study helps to assess and quantify the risk of future large asteroid impacts. In addition, the ability to reproduce mega-events like this is an important validation that the models can help scientists forecast global impacts of more conventional tsunamis that humanity has to deal with. In a future study, PMEL\u2019s Vasily Titov plans to model the extent of coastal flooding caused by this tsunami, which will further inform tsunami impact forecasts. For more information, see the original University of Michigan press release, NOAA release, or AGU Advances Research Article.\n\nThe Chicxulub crater is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is offshore near the community of Chicxulub, after which it is named. The crater is estimated to be 180 kilometers (110 miles) in diameter and 20 kilometers (12 miles) deep. Its position has shifted from its original impact location 66 million years ago due to the movement of the plates.\n\nThe date of the impact coincides with the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary (commonly known as the K\u2013Pg or K\u2013T boundary). It is now widely accepted that the resulting devastation and climate disruption was the cause of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction of 75% of plant and animal species on Earth, including all non-avian dinosaurs.",

    "description": "At 5:36 pm on Friday, March 27, 1964 (28 March, 03:36Z UTC) the largest earthquake ever measured in North America, and the second-largest recorded anywhere, struck 40 miles west of Valdez, Alaska in Prince William Sound with a moment magnitude we now know to be 9.2. Almost an hour and a half later the Honolulu Magnetic and Seismic Observatory (later renamed the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, or PTWC) was able to issue its first \u201ctidal wave advisory\u201d that noted that a tsunami was possible and that it could arrive in the Hawaiian Islands five hours later. Upon learning of a tsunami observation in Kodiak Island, Alaska, an hour and a half later the Honolulu Observatory issued a formal \u201ctidal wave/seismic sea-wave warning\u201d cautioning that damage was possible in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Ocean but that it was not possible to predict the intensity of the tsunami. The earthquake did in fact generate a tsunami that killed 124 people (106 in Alaska, 13 in California, and 5 in Oregon) and caused about $2.3 billion (2016 dollars) in property loss all along the Pacific coast of North America from Alaska to southern California and in Hawaii. The greatest wave heights were in Alaska at over 67 m or 220 ft. and waves almost 10 m or 32 ft high struck British Columbia, Canada. In the \u201clower 48\u201d waves as high as 4.5 m or 15 ft. struck Washington, as high as 3.7 m or 12 ft. struck Oregon, and as high as 4.8 m or over 15 ft. struck California. Waves of similar size struck Hawaii at nearly 5 m or over 16 ft. high. Waves over 1 m or 3 ft. high also struck Mexico, Chile, and even New Zealand.\n\nAs part of its response to this event the United States government created a second tsunami warning facility in 1967 at the Palmer Observatory, Alaska--now called the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) --to help mitigate future tsunami threats to Alaska, Canada, and the U.S. Mainland.\n\nToday, more than 50 years since the Great Alaska Earthquake, PTWC and NTWC issue tsunami warnings in minutes, not hours, after a major earthquake occurs, and will also forecast how large any resulting tsunami will be as it is still crossing the ocean. PTWC can also create an animation of a historical tsunami with the same tool that it uses to determine tsunami hazards in real time for any tsunami today: the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model. The RIFT model takes earthquake information as input and calculates how the waves move through the world\u2019s oceans, predicting their speed, wavelength, and amplitude. This animation shows these values through the simulated motion of the waves and as they travel through the world\u2019s oceans one can also see the distance between successive wave crests (wavelength) as well as their height (half-amplitude) indicated by their color. More importantly, the model also shows what happens when these tsunami waves strike land, the very information that PTWC needs to issue tsunami hazard guidance for impacted coastlines. From the beginning the animation shows all coastlines covered by colored points. These are initially a blue color like the undisturbed ocean to indicate normal sea level, but as the tsunami waves reach them they will change color to represent the height of the waves coming ashore, and often these values are higher than they were in the deeper waters offshore. The color scheme is based on PTWC\u2019s warning criteria, with blue-to-green representing no hazard (less than 30 cm or ~1 ft.), yellow-to-orange indicating low hazard with a stay-off-the-beach recommendation (30 to 100 cm or ~1 to 3 ft.), light red-to-bright red indicating significant hazard requiring evacuation (1 to 3 m or ~3 to 10 ft.), and dark red indicating a severe hazard possibly requiring a second-tier evacuation (greater than 3 m or ~10 ft.).\n\nToward the end of this simulated 48 hours of activity the wave animation will transition to the \u201cenergy map\u201d of a mathematical surface representing the maximum rise in sea-level on the open ocean caused by the tsunami, a pattern that indicates that the kinetic energy of the tsunami was not distributed evenly across the oceans but instead forms a highly directional \u201cbeam\u201d such that the tsunami was far more severe in the middle of the \u201cbeam\u201d of energy than on its sides. This pattern also generally correlates to the coastal impacts; note how those coastlines directly in the \u201cbeam\u201d are hit by larger waves than those to either side of it.\n\nYou can also view a YouTube version of this animation.\n\nEarthquake source used: Johnson, J.

    "description": "On April 1, 1946 at 4:28 am (12:28 UTC), an 8.6 moment magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Unimak Island in Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands, generating a tsunami that caused the greatest damage and number of deaths in Hawaii\u2019s history, leading to the creation of the United States\u2019 first tsunami warning system. As is typical for dangerous tsunamis the greatest wave heights were nearest the epicenter. The waves reached as high as 42 m or about 138 ft. on Unimak Island and destroyed its lighthouse and killed the five people there. Elsewhere this tsunami caused the greatest damage and number of deaths on inhabited Pacific islands. In Hawaii the waves reached about 17 m or 55 ft. high and killed 158 people, most in the town of Hilo, while in the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia the waves reached even higher to 20 m or 65 ft but killed only two people. Chile\u2019s Easter Island also got nearly 9 m or 28 ft.while its Juan Fernandez Islands got nearly 3 m or 9 ft. high waves. Pitcairn Island also had 5 m or 16 ft. high waves, New Zealand had over 2 m or 8 ft. high waves, and Samoa had over 1 m or about 4 ft. high waves. In North America the highest waves were in California at over 2 m or over 8 ft. and killed one person there and in South America it killed one more person in Peru.\n\nA tsunami warning system did not exist in 1946 and no one had any warning of the approaching dangerous waves. In response to this event the United States government set up its first tsunami warning operation at the Honolulu Magnetic and Seismic Observatory in 1948 to mitigate tsunami hazards in Hawaii. This facility would later be renamed the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) and expand its mission to include the rest of the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nToday, 70 years since the Unimak Island Earthquake, PTWC will issue tsunami warnings in minutes after a major earthquake occurs and will also forecast how large any resulting tsunami will be as it is still crossing the ocean.

    "description": "At 4:22 am on Saturday, March 9, 1957 (9 March, 14:22 Z UTC) the second great earthquake in 11 years struck Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands. This earthquake had the same magnitude of the earlier earthquake--8.6 on the moment magnitude scale (Johnson et al. 1994)--but was to the west of the 1946 earthquake, near the Andreanof Islands. As with the earlier event it also caused a dangerous tsunami that caused significant damage in the Aleutian Islands and in Hawaii and was observed as far away as Chile. The greatest wave heights were in Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands, with waves nearly 23 m or 75 ft. high coming ashore on Unimak Island. The tsunami would reach Hawaii a little over four hours later, with the largest waves striking the island of Kauai at over 11 m or 38 ft. high and would cause $5.3 million in damage statewide ($46 million in 2017), including the destruction of more than 80 homes. Elsewhere around the Pacific Ocean the tsunami waves would reach heights of 6 m or 20 ft. in the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), 3 m or 10 ft. in Japan, 1.5 m or 5 ft. in American Samoa, and over 1 m or 3 ft. in Mexico and Chile. Unlike the earlier event, however, it did not kill any people thanks to effective tsunami alerts from to the Honolulu Observatory and the Seismic Sea Wave Warning System. These efforts, established in 1948, would later become the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) and Pacific Tsunami Warning System.\n\nToday, more than 60 years since this earthquake, PTWC will issue tsunami warnings in minutes after a major earthquake occurs, and will also forecast how large any resulting tsunami will be as it is still crossing the ocean. PTWC can also create an animation of a historical tsunami with the same tool that it uses to determine tsunami hazards in real time for any tsunami today: the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model. The RIFT model takes earthquake information as input and calculates how the waves move through the world\u2019s oceans, predicting their speed, wavelength, and amplitude. This animation shows these values through the simulated motion of the waves and as they travel through the world\u2019s oceans one can also see the distance between successive wave crests (wavelength) as well as their height (amplitude) indicated by their color. More importantly, the model also shows what happens when these tsunami waves strike land, the very information that PTWC needs to issue tsunami hazard guidance for impacted coastlines. From the beginning the animation shows all coastlines covered by colored points. These are initially a blue color like the undisturbed ocean to indicate normal sea level, but as the tsunami waves reach them they will change color to represent the height of the waves coming ashore, and often these values are higher than they were in the deeper waters offshore. The color scheme is based on PTWC's warning criteria, with blue-to-green representing no hazard (less than 30 cm or ~1 ft.), yellow-to-orange indicating low hazard with a stay-off-the-beach recommendation (30 to 100 cm or ~1 to 3 ft.), light red-to-bright red indicating significant hazard requiring evacuation (1 to 3 m or ~3 to 10 ft.), and dark red indicating a severe hazard possibly requiring a second-tier evacuation (greater than 3 m or ~10 ft.).\n\nToward the end of this simulated 48 hours of activity the wave animation will transition to the \"energy map\" of a mathematical surface representing the maximum rise in sea-level on the open ocean caused by the tsunami, a pattern that indicates that the kinetic energy of the tsunami was not distributed evenly across the oceans but instead forms a highly directional \"beam\" such that the tsunami was far more severe in the middle of the \"beam\" of energy than on its sides. This pattern also generally correlates to the coastal impacts; note how those coastlines directly in the \u201cbeam\u201d are hit by larger waves than those to either side of it.\n\nYou can also view a YouTube version of this animation.",

    "description": "Just before midnight on January 27, 1700 a tsunami struck the coasts of Japan without warning since no one in Japan felt the earthquake that must have caused it. Nearly 300 years later scientists and historians in Japan and the United States solved the mystery of what caused this \"orphan tsunami\" through careful analysis of historical records in Japan as well as oral histories of Native Americans, sediment deposits, and ghost forests of drowned trees in the Pacific Northwest of North America, a region also known as Cascadia. They learned that this geologically active region, the Cascadia Subduction Zone, not only hosts erupting volcanoes but also produces megathrust earthquakes capable of generating devastating, ocean-crossing tsunamis. By comparing the tree rings of dead trees with those still living they could tell when the last of these great earthquakes struck the region. The trees all died in the winter of 1699 - 1700 when the coasts of northern California, Oregon, and Washington suddenly dropped 1- 2 m (3.3 - 6.6 ft.), flooding them with seawater. That much motion over such a large area requires a very large earthquake to explain it - perhaps as large as 9.2 magnitude, comparable to the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964. Such an earthquake would have ruptured the earth along the entire length of the 1000 km (~600 mi) long fault of the Cascadia Subduction Zone and severe shaking could have lasted for 5 minutes or longer. Its tsunami would cross the Pacific Ocean and reach Japan in about 9 hours, so the earthquake must have occurred around 9:00 at night in Cascadia on January 26, 1700 (05:00 January 27 UTC).\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) can create an animation of a historical tsunami like this one using the same tool, the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model, that they use for determining tsunami hazard in real time for any tsunami today. The RIFT model takes earthquake information as input and calculates how the waves move through the world's oceans, predicting their speed, wavelength, and amplitude. This animation shows these values through the simulated motion of the waves, and as they race around the globe one can also see the distance between successive wave crests (wavelength) as well as their height (half-amplitude) indicated by their color. More importantly, the model also shows what happens when these tsunami waves strike land, the very information that PTWC needs to issue tsunami hazard guidance for impacted coastlines. From the beginning, the animation shows all coastlines covered by colored points. These are initially a blue color like the undisturbed ocean to indicate normal sea level, but as the tsunami waves reach them they will change color to represent the height of the waves coming ashore, and often these values are higher than they were in the deeper waters offshore. The color scheme is based on PTWC's warning criteria, with blue-to-green representing no hazard (< 30 cm or ~1 ft.), yellow-to-orange indicating low hazard with a stay-off-the-beach recommendation (30 - 100 cm or ~1 - 3 ft.), light red-to-bright red indicating significant hazard requiring evacuation (1 - 3 m or ~3 - 10 ft.), and dark red indicating a severe hazard possibly requiring a second-tier evacuation (> 3 m or > ~10 ft.).\n\nToward the end of this simulated 48 hours of activity, the wave animation will transition to the \"energy map\" of a mathematical surface representing the maximum rise in sea level on the open ocean caused by the tsunami, a pattern that indicates that the kinetic energy of the tsunami was not distributed evenly across the oceans but instead forms a highly directional \"beam\" such that the tsunami was far more severe in the middle of the \"beam\" of energy than on its sides. This pattern also generally correlates to the coastal impacts; note how those coastlines directly in the \"beam\" have a much higher impact than those to either side of it.\n\nThe full report about the Orphan Tsunami of 1700 can be found here.\n\nFor a YouTube version of this animation, please see: https://youtu.be/4W2iUl0VB8c",

    "description": "On May 22, 1960, at 3:11 pm (19:11 UTC) the largest earthquake ever recorded by instruments struck southern Chile with a magnitude we now know to be at least 9.5. This earthquake generated a tsunami that traveled through every ocean on earth, though large, dangerous waves only impacted the coastlines around the Pacific Ocean. Chile suffered the greatest impact, with tsunami waves reaching as high as 25 m or 82 ft., killing an estimated 2000 people there. Outside of Chile the tsunami was worst on the opposite side of the planet in Japan, where waves reached as high as 6.3 m or over 20 ft and killed 139 people. In between and halfway across the Pacific Ocean Hawaii suffered the second-worst tsunami in its recorded history--only the Aleutian Islands tsunami of 1946 was worse. It killed 61 people in the town of Hilo with waves reaching as high as 10.7 m or about 35 ft. and all Hawaiian Islands experienced waves well over 1 m or 3 ft. The Philippines also lost 21 people to waves recorded as high as 1.5 m or nearly 5 ft, and two more people died in California from waves reaching 2.2 m or over 7 ft. high. Elsewhere around the Pacific Ocean tsunami waves reached as high as 12.2 m or 40 ft at Pitcairn Island (U.K), 7.0 m or 23 ft. in Russia (Kamchatka), 5.0 m or over 16 ft. in New Zealand, 4.9 m or 16 ft. in (Western) Samoa, 2.4 m or about 8 ft. in French Polynesia, 2.1 m or 7 ft. in Canada, 1.8 m or about 6 ft. in Papua New Guinea, and 1.2 m or about 4 ft. in Mexico. In the United States and it territories 2.4 m or about 8 ft. in American Samoa, 2.3 m or 7.5 ft. in Alaska, and 1.8 m or about 6 ft. in Oregon.\n\nA global tsunami warning system did not exist in 1960 and the Honolulu Magnetic and Seismic Observatory, which would later become the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC), did issue tsunami warnings for this earthquake to the State of Hawaii many hours in advance of its arrival (it would take almost 15 hours for the first wave to reach Hawaii). As a result of this tsunami the United Nations would set up the Pacific Tsunami Warning System (PTWS) in 1965 with the Honolulu Observatory as its headquarters.\n\nToday, more than 50 years since the Great Chile Earthquake and the establishment of the PTWS, the PTWC will issue tsunami warnings in minutes, not hours, after a major earthquake occurs, and will forecast how large any resulting tsunami will be as it is still crossing the ocean. The PTWC can also create an animation of a historical tsunami with the same tool that it uses to determine tsunami hazards in real time for any tsunami today: the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model.

    "description": "At 3:34 on the morning of February 27, 2010 (06:34 UTC), an 8.8 moment magnitude earthquake struck near the coastline of central Chile. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) quickly determined that the large magnitude of this earthquake, its location near the coastline, its relatively shallow depth within the earth, and a history of megathrust earthquakes in the region meant that it could have moved the seafloor and thus posed a significant tsunami risk and PTWC issued their first tsunami warning several minutes later for Chile and Peru. The earthquake did in fact cause a tsunami, and over the following hours as PTWC learned more about the earthquake (confirming it was a megathrust and upgrading its magnitude) and its tsunami through forecast models and direct observation with DART sensors and coastal sea-level gauges PTWC would eventually issue tsunami warnings to the State of Hawaii and all 43 countries and territories participating the Pacific Tsunami Warning System, keeping warnings in some areas in effect for more than a day. PTWC\u2019s sister office, the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (now known as the National Tsunami Warning Center), also issued tsunami advisories for Alaska and the Pacific coasts of the United States and Canada. The tsunami caused the greatest devastation and 124 deaths in Chile, where waves reached as high as 29 m or 95 ft. on the mainland, over 18 m or 60 ft. in its Juan Fernandez Islands, and over 4 m or 14 ft. at Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Outside of Chile tsunami wave heights exceeded 1 m or 3 ft. in the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), New Zealand, the Kuril Islands (Russia), and in the United States in California and Hawaii, and caused minor damage in San Diego, California and in Japan.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) can create an animation of a historical tsunami like this one using the same tool that it uses to determine tsunami hazards in real time for any tsunami today: the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model. The RIFT model takes earthquake information as input and calculates how the waves move through the world\u2019s oceans, predicting their speed, wavelength, and amplitude. This animation shows these values through the simulated motion of the waves and as they travel through the world\u2019s oceans one can also see the distance between successive wave crests (wavelength) as well as their height (half-amplitude) indicated by their color. More importantly, the model also shows what happens when these tsunami waves strike land, the very information that PTWC needs to issue tsunami hazard guidance for impacted coastlines. From the beginning the animation shows all coastlines covered by colored points. These are initially a blue color like the undisturbed ocean to indicate normal sea level, but as the tsunami waves reach them they will change color to represent the height of the waves coming ashore, and often these values are higher than they were in the deeper waters offshore. The color scheme is based on PTWC\u2019s warning criteria, with blue-to-green representing no hazard (less than 30 cm or ~1 ft.), yellow-to-orange indicating low hazard with a stay-off-the-beach recommendation (30 to 100 cm or ~1 to 3 ft.), light red-to-bright red indicating significant hazard requiring evacuation (1 to 3 m or ~3 to 10 ft.), and dark red indicating a severe hazard possibly requiring a second-tier evacuation (greater than 3 m or ~10 ft.).\n\nToward the end of this simulated 48 hours of activity the wave animation will transition to the \u201cenergy map\u201d of a mathematical surface representing the maximum rise in sea-level on the open ocean caused by the tsunami, a pattern that indicates that the kinetic energy of the tsunami was not distributed evenly across the oceans but instead forms a highly directional \u201cbeam\u201d such that the tsunami was far more severe in the middle of the \u201cbeam\u201d of energy than on its sides. This pattern also generally correlates to the coastal impacts; note how those coastlines directly in the \u201cbeam\u201d are hit by larger waves than those to either side of it.\n\nFor a YouTube version of this animation click here.",

    "description": "At 14:46 in the afternoon of March 11, 2011 (05:46 UTC), a 9.0 moment magnitude earthquake struck near the coastline of Honshu, Japan. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) quickly determined that the very large magnitude of this earthquake, its offshore location, its relatively shallow depth within the earth, and a history of megathrust earthquakes in the region meant that it likely moved the seafloor and thus posed a significant tsunami risk. As per international agreements Japanese authorities issued tsunami warnings for their own coastlines while PTWC began issuing warnings to other countries and territories in the western Pacific Ocean. The earthquake did in fact cause a tsunami, and over the following hours as PTWC learned more about the earthquake (confirming it was a megathrust and upgrading its magnitude) and its tsunami through forecast models and direct observation with DART sensors and coastal sea-level gauges PTWC would eventually issue tsunami warnings to the State of Hawaii and all remaining countries and territories participating the Pacific Tsunami Warning System, keeping warnings in some areas in effect for more than a day. PTWC\u2019s sister office, the West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (now known as the National Tsunami Warning Center), also issued tsunami warnings for Alaska and the Pacific coasts of the United States and Canada. The tsunami caused the greatest devastation and over 17,000 deaths in Japan, where waves reached over 40 m or 130 ft. high. Outside of Japan the tsunami also killed one person in Papua, Indonesia and rose to greater than 5 m or 16 ft. in the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), greater than 2m or 6.5 ft. in Indonesia, Russia's Kuril Islands, and in Chile, and rose to greater than 1 m or 3 ft. in Costa Rica, the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), Mexico, Papua New Guinea, and Peru. In the United States the tsunami rose to more than 5 m or 16 ft. in Hawaii, more than 2 m or 6.5 ft in California and Oregon, and more than 1 m or 3 ft. in the U.S. island territories of Midway and Saipan (Northern Mariana Islands). The tsunami also killed one person in Crescent City, California.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) can create an animation of a historical tsunami like this one using the same tool that it uses to determine tsunami hazards in real time for any tsunami today: the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model. The RIFT model takes earthquake information as input and calculates how the waves move through the world\u2019s oceans, predicting their speed, wavelength, and amplitude. This animation shows these values through the simulated motion of the waves and as they travel through the world\u2019s oceans one can also see the distance between successive wave crests (wavelength) as well as their height (half-amplitude) indicated by their color. More importantly, the model also shows what happens when these tsunami waves strike land, the very information that PTWC needs to issue tsunami hazard guidance for impacted coastlines. From the beginning the animation shows all coastlines covered by colored points. These are initially a blue color like the undisturbed ocean to indicate normal sea level, but as the tsunami waves reach them they will change color to represent the height of the waves coming ashore, and often these values are higher than they were in the deeper waters offshore. The color scheme is based on PTWC\u2019s warning criteria, with blue-to-green representing no hazard (less than 30 cm or ~1 ft.), yellow-to-orange indicating low hazard with a stay-off-the-beach recommendation (30 to 100 cm or ~1 to 3 ft.), light red-to-bright red indicating significant hazard requiring evacuation (1 to 3 m or ~3 to 10 ft.), and dark red indicating a severe hazard possibly requiring a second-tier evacuation (greater than 3 m or ~10 ft.).\n\nToward the end of this simulated 48 hours of activity the wave animation will transition to the \u201cenergy map\u201d of a mathematical surface representing the maximum rise in sea-level on the open ocean caused by the tsunami, a pattern that indicates that the kinetic energy of the tsunami was not distributed evenly across the oceans but instead forms a highly directional \u201cbeam\u201d such that the tsunami was far more severe in the middle of the \u201cbeam\u201d of energy than on its sides.

    "description": "On the morning of November 1, 1755, a great earthquake shook Portugal's capital city of Lisbon as worshipers filled churches and cathedrals for the All Saints' Day Mass. In seconds it left the city in ruins and in minutes those ruins were on fire. The earthquake probably killed about 30,000 people, though some estimates double that figure. Many of the survivors fled to the wharves and keys of Lisbon's port, but they would find no safety there. The first tsunami wave surged up the Tagus estuary about an hour after the earthquake, reached a maximum runup of 12 meters (40 feet), and killed another 1000 people. At least two more tsunami waves surged into the city, completing the earthquake's destruction.\n\nAt Portugal's coastal city of Lagos the tsunami was even larger, perhaps 30 m (100 ft). It went on to damage the ports of Cadiz in Spain, then Safi and Agadir in Morocco. The tsunami also spread north: it caused minor damage at Brest in Brittany, some flooding in England in the Scilly Islands and in Cornwall, and extensively flooded of the low-lying areas of the city of Cork, Ireland. As it spread out across the Atlantic, the tsunami first reached Madeira, where observers recorded a runup of 4 m (13 ft), then the Canary Islands, the Azores, and eventually the West Indies, where observers recorded runups of about a 1 m (3 ft) in Barbados, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Antigua (and questionable reports of large runup in the Virgin Islands). Though the tsunami must have hit Colonial America, no one recorded it there, though it was observed in Newfoundland.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) can create an animation of a historical tsunami like this one using the same tool that it uses to determine tsunami hazards in real time for any tsunami today: the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model. The RIFT model takes earthquake information as input and calculates how the waves move through the world\u2019s oceans, predicting their speed, wavelength, and amplitude. This animation shows these values through the simulated motion of the waves and as they travel through the world\u2019s oceans one can also see the distance between successive wave crests (wavelength) as well as their height (half-amplitude) indicated by their color. More importantly, the model also shows what happens when these tsunami waves strike land, the very information that PTWC needs to issue tsunami hazard guidance for impacted coastlines. From the beginning the animation shows all coastlines covered by colored points. These are initially a blue color like the undisturbed ocean to indicate normal sea level, but as the tsunami waves reach them they will change color to represent the height of the waves coming ashore, and often these values are higher than they were in the deeper waters offshore. The color scheme is based on PTWC\u2019s warning criteria, with blue-to-green representing no hazard (less than 30 cm or ~1 ft.), yellow-to-orange indicating low hazard with a stay-off-the-beach recommendation (30 to 100 cm or ~1 to 3 ft.), light red-to-bright red indicating significant hazard requiring evacuation (1 to 3 m or ~3 to 10 ft.), and dark red indicating a severe hazard possibly requiring a second-tier evacuation (greater than 3 m or ~10 ft.).\n\nOur model of this tsunami assumes its source was a magnitude 8.5 earthquake on the Horseshoe Fault off of Cape Finisterre. Baptista, et al. (2011) explain how this fault matches the tsunami observations better than the several other proposed sources for the Great Lisbon Earthquake.\n\nToward the end of this simulated 48 hours of activity the wave animation will transition to the \u201cenergy map\u201d of a mathematical surface representing the maximum rise in sea-level on the open ocean caused by the tsunami, a pattern that indicates that the kinetic energy of the tsunami was not distributed evenly across the oceans but instead forms a highly directional \u201cbeam\u201d such that the tsunami was far more severe in the middle of the \u201cbeam\u201d of energy than on its sides. This pattern also generally correlates to the coastal impacts; note how those coastlines directly in the \u201cbeam\u201d are hit by larger waves than those to either side of it.\n\nYou can view a YouTube version of this animation here.\n\nEarthquake source used: Baptista, M.A., Miranda, J.M., Omira, R., & Antunes, C.

    "description": "At 6:48 on the morning of September 29, 2009 (17:48 UTC), an 8.1 moment magnitude earthquake struck near the Samoan Islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) quickly determined that the large magnitude of this earthquake, its location under the sea floor, its relatively shallow depth within the earth, and a history of tsunami-causing earthquakes in the region meant that it could have moved the seafloor and thus posed a significant tsunami risk. PTWC issued its first tsunami warning several minutes later for Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, and other nearby island groups. The earthquake did in fact cause a dangerous tsunami, and over the following hours PTWC tracked it through the Pacific Ocean and updated its alerts with measured tsunami wave heights and recommended that additional areas consider coastal evacuation. PTWC canceled all tsunami alerts about four hours after the earthquake.\n\nDestructive waves only struck islands near the earthquake\u2019s epicenter, where casualties were significant. The tsunami reached over 12 m or nearly 40 ft. high in Samoa, killing 149 people there. In nearby American Samoa the waves were even higher at over 17 m or 55 ft, killing 34, and topped 22 m or 72 ft in Tonga, killing 9 more people there. Smaller waves traveled throughout the Pacific Ocean but caused no more deaths or damage.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) can create an animation of a historical tsunami like this one with the same tool that it uses to determine tsunami hazards in real time for any tsunami today: the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model. The RIFT model takes earthquake information as input and calculates how the waves move through the world\u2019s oceans, predicting their speed, wavelength, and amplitude. This animation shows these values through the simulated motion of the waves and as they travel through the world\u2019s oceans one can also see the distance between successive wave crests (wavelength) as well as their height (half-amplitude) indicated by their color. More importantly, the model also shows what happens when these tsunami waves strike land, the very information that PTWC needs to issue tsunami hazard guidance for impacted coastlines. From the beginning the animation shows all coastlines covered by colored points. These are initially a blue color like the undisturbed ocean to indicate normal sea level, but as the tsunami waves reach them they will change color to represent the height of the waves coming ashore, and often these values are higher than they were in the deeper waters offshore. The color scheme is based on PTWC\u2019s warning criteria, with blue-to-green representing no hazard (less than 30 cm or ~1 ft.), yellow-to-orange indicating low hazard with a stay-off-the-beach recommendation (30 to 100 cm or ~1 to 3 ft.), light red-to-bright red indicating significant hazard requiring evacuation (1 to 3 m or ~3 to 10 ft.), and dark red indicating a severe hazard possibly requiring a second-tier evacuation (greater than 3 m or ~10 ft.).\n\nToward the end of this simulated 48 hours of activity the wave animation will transition to the \u201cenergy map\u201d of a mathematical surface representing the maximum rise in sea-level on the open ocean caused by the tsunami, a pattern that indicates that the kinetic energy of the tsunami was not distributed evenly across the oceans but instead forms a highly directional \u201cbeam\u201d such that the tsunami was far more severe in the middle of the \u201cbeam\u201d of energy than on its sides.

    "description": "The magnitude 9.1 Great Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake of December 26, 2004, spawned the deadliest tsunami in history, killing more than 230,000 people in 14 countries around the Indian Ocean. More than half of those killed had lived in Acheh Province, Sumatra, where the tsunami rose as high as 30 m (100 ft.) and traveled more than 4 km (2.5 mi.) inland in this low-lying region.\n\nThis earthquake began at its epicenter near northern Sumatra and moved the earth's crust an average of 15 m (50 ft.) as it ruptured northward for at least 1200 km (750 mi.) almost to the coast of Myanmar (Burma) over an 8-minute period. This distance is at least 200 km (125 mi.) longer than the length of fault that moved during the largest earthquake ever recorded, the magnitude 9.5 Great Chile Earthquake of 1960.\n\nThis animation shows why this south-to-north rupture is important for understanding the behavior of this tsunami, and why such \"progressive\" rupture needs to be considered for future tsunami forecasting. If the earthquake had moved the fault along its entire length all-at-once it would have sent the largest tsunami waves perpendicular to the fault and so they would have passed south of Sri Lanka. The earthquake motion, however, started in the south and moved northward along the fault so the tsunami began radiating from near Sumatra before it could be generated near Myanmar, thus causing the largest tsunami waves to strike Sri Lanka and Somalia directly, consistent with the tsunami waves actually observed in those countries.\n\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) can create an animation of a historical tsunami like this one using the same tool that it uses to determine tsunami hazards in real time for any tsunami today: the Real-Time Forecasting of Tsunamis (RIFT) forecast model. The RIFT model takes earthquake information as input and calculates how the waves move through the world\u2019s oceans, predicting their speed, wavelength, and amplitude. This animation shows these values through the simulated motion of the waves and as they travel through the world\u2019s oceans one can also see the distance between successive wave crests (wavelength) as well as their height (amplitude) indicated by their color. More importantly, the model also shows what happens when these tsunami waves strike land, the very information that PTWC needs to issue tsunami hazard guidance for impacted coastlines. From the beginning the animation shows all coastlines covered by colored points. These are initially a blue color like the undisturbed ocean to indicate normal sea level, but as the tsunami waves reach them they will change color to represent the height of the waves coming ashore, and often these values are higher than they were in the deeper waters offshore. The color scheme is based on PTWC's warning criteria, with blue-to-green representing no hazard (less than 30 cm or ~1 ft.), yellow-to-orange indicating low hazard with a stay-off-the-beach recommendation (30 to 100 cm or ~1 to 3 ft.), light red-to-bright red indicating significant hazard requiring evacuation (1 to 3 m or ~3 to 10 ft.), and dark red indicating a severe hazard possibly requiring a second-tier evacuation (greater than 3 m or ~10 ft.).\n\nToward the end of this simulated 48 hours of activity the wave animation will transition to the \"energy map\" of a mathematical surface representing the maximum rise in sea-level on the open ocean caused by the tsunami, a pattern that indicates that the kinetic energy of the tsunami was not distributed evenly across the oceans but instead forms a highly directional \"beam\" such that the tsunami was far more severe in the middle of the \"beam\" of energy than on its sides. This pattern also generally correlates to the coastal impacts; note how those coastlines directly in the \"beam\" are hit by larger waves than those to either side of it.\n\nYou can view a YouTube version of this animation here.",

The earthquake itself, the third largest in the world since 1900, caused severe damage and casualties in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, and in the Nicobar Islands, India. International tsunami survey teams with experts from many countries surveyed the coasts of almost all of the Indian Ocean countries that were affected by the tsunami.\n\nThis dataset depicts a model run of predicted tsunami wave heights from the Center for Tsunami Research at the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. It shows the predicted maximum wave heights of the tsunami as it travels across the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific basins. The largest wave heights occur closest to the epicenter near Sumatra. The wave decreases in height as it travels across open water but grows taller as it encounters shallower waters near coast areas.\n\nThis tsunami was more deadly than any other tsunami in recorded history, with 227,899 dead or missing. The worst hit country was Indonesia with 167,540 listed as dead or missing and damages of $4,451.6 million. The remaining fatalities occurred in Sri Lanka (35,322), India (16,269), Thailand (8,212), Somalia (289), Maldives (108), Malaysia (75), Myanmar (61), Tanzania (13), Bangladesh (2), Seychelles (2), South Africa (2), Yemen (2), Kenya (1), and Madagascar (1).

    "description": "This dataset is a model put run by the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory that simulates the waves of the December 26, 2004 tsunami during the first 54 hours after it occurred. A tsunami is a series of waves generated when a body of water, such as an ocean, is rapidly displaced on a massive scale. Historically tsunamis have been referred to as tidal waves, but that name is discouraged by oceanographers because tides have little effect on tsunamis. The bright areas indicate the wave crests while the dark areas are the wave troughs. The scale of this visualization is capped at 20 cm, which allows viewers to see the propagation of the wave across open water, however it should be noted that the wave heights were much higher in the shallower coastal waters.\n\nThe infamous Sumatra Tsunami on December 26, 2004, was the result of a massive earthquake that occurred when the India tectonic plate subducted beneath the Burma plate, causing an earthquake with a magnitude of at least 9.0 on the Richter scale. This displaced a huge amount of water. Out in the depths of the ocean, the wave heights do not increase dramatically. But as the waves travel inland, the depth of the ocean gets shallower causing the waves to build up. Waves with heights of 35.5 feet were reported during the Sumatra Tsunami. The speed of the waves depends on the ocean depth rather than the distance from the source of the wave. The waves travel faster over deep waters and slower over shallow waters as they build up. This allowed the Sumatra Tsunami to propagate worldwide in just one day. An estimated 230,000 people were killed as a result of the tsunami, 168,000 in Indonesia alone. One reason for the widespread devastation was the lack of a warning system. Previously thought unnecessary in the Indian Ocean because the last major tsunami was in 1883, efforts are underway by the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research to make a worldwide tsunami detection system a reality.",

Runup heights of 5 to 20 m were measured on the coasts of Thailand and 4 to 12 m in Sri Lanka and India. More than 5,000 km away in Somalia, runup heights of almost 10 m were measured.

If confirmed, it would beat the previous record holder, Hurricane Camille (1969). This dataset is taken from the Real-Time Linear IR satellite dataset from October 30th to November 12th, 2013.\n\nThe thirteenth named storm of the season, the system originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Micronesia on November 2nd. Tracking westward, it formed as a tropical depression the following day. Once receiving its name on November 4th it began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity on November 5th. On November 6th, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated it as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale and it passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau shortly after.\n\nHaiyan continued to intensify and on November 7th the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated the system's one-minute sustained winds were 315 km/hr (195 mph). Several hours later, the eye of the cyclone made it's first landfall in the Philippines at Guiuan, Eastern Samar without losing any intensity. Gradually weakening, the storm made five additional landfalls in the country before emerging over the South China Sea.\n\nThe devastation in the Philippines included Samar Island and Leyte where thousands were left dead and hundreds of thousands were left homeless.\n\nA layer called Typhoon Track is built-in to this dataset, which can be toggled on using the layer tab in the iPad Remote App 4.0+. The colors represent the intensity, red is the highest (category 5-equivalent) and white is the lowest (tropical storm).",

    "description": "Typhoon Haiyan, also known in the Phillippines as Typhoon Yolanda, may be the strongest recorded tropical cyclone to make landfall with sustained speeds up to 195 mph. If confirmed, it would beat the previous record holder, Hurricane Camille (1969). This dataset is taken from the Real-Time Linear IR satellite dataset and Real-time: SST from October 30th to November 12th, 2013.\n\nThe thirteenth named storm of the season, the system originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Micronesia on November 2nd. Tracking westward, it formed as a tropical depression the following day. Once receiving its name on November 4th it began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity on November 5th. On November 6th, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated it as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale and it passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau shortly after.\n\nHaiyan continued to intensify and on November 7th the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated the system's one-minute sustained winds were 315 km/hr (195 mph). Several hours later, the eye of the cyclone made it's first landfall in the Philippines at Guiuan, Eastern Samar without losing any intensity. Gradually weakening, the storm made five additional landfalls in the country before emerging over the South China Sea.\n\nThe devastation in the Philippines included Samar Island and Leyte where thousands were left dead and hundreds of thousands were left homeless.",

It is also the least geologically active satellite with a heavily cratered surface indicating that it is old. Near the equator of Umbriel is a bright ring referred to the as the Fluorescent Cheerio or Wunda. The origin of this is unknown, though it is believed to be the floor of a crater.",

    "description": "Uranus, the first planet to be discovered in the modern times, was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel. Uranus has 27 moons, all of which were named after characters from the stories of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. One of the most unique features of Uranus is that it is essentially tipped on its side, with a 98\u00b0ree tilt. This means that in summer and winter, one pole is essentially pointed towards the sun while the other is pointed away. Despite this orientation, the equator is still the warmest location on the planet. It is unknown how this happens because the sunward pole receives the most energy from the sun. Uranus circles the sun once every 84.01 Earth years.\n\nThe atmosphere of Uranus is composed of 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane. Unlike Saturn and Jupiter, two other gas planets, it appears that Uranus does not have a rocky core. Instead, it is thought that Uranus' mass is evenly distributed throughout the area of planet. One feature that is similar to the other gas planets is the fast moving winds that blow the clouds around in the atmosphere. In the mid-latitudes of Uranus the winds blow in the direction of the planets rotation at 90 - 360 mph (40 - 160kmh). At the equator, the winds appear to blow in the opposite direction. These bands of opposing winds are responsible for the color variations on the planet. The blue shading of Uranus is due to the methane in the upper atmosphere. The methane absorbs red light giving Uranus that bluish-green color.",

It is also home to some of the busiest beaches in the world, where Southern Californians and tourists from all over the world come to enjoy recreation and scenery. Marine life flourishes here in one of the most biologically productive areas of the entire Pacific Ocean, and large and diverse assemblages of whales migrate along this coast.\n\nSolutions are needed to reduce society's conflicts with coastal and marine ecosystems and to stimulate appropriate and compatible human uses.

    "description": "Venus has been referred to as the sister or even twin to Earth by many because of its similar chemical composition, density and size. That, however, is where the similarities end. Venus is not only the hottest planet in the solar system, but also the brightest. Both of these characteristics are the result of the atmosphere that surrounds the planet, which is mainly composed of carbon dioxide and some sulfuric acid. This composition allows for the greenhouse effect to be astronomical causing the planet to have a constant temperature of 864\u00b0F. The planet is the brightest because the clouds, composed of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid, are highly reflective. The pressure of the atmosphere that surrounds Venus is 90 times that of the atmosphere around Earth, crushing any probes that land on Venus in a matter of hours.\n\nThe orbit of Venus is the most circular in the solar system, with the perihelion (position closest to sun) and aphelion (position farthest from sun) varying only by roughly 1%. The average distance to the sun from Venus is 67,237,910 miles. An interesting feature of Venus is that the sun rises in the West and sets in the East; a result of its retrograde rotation. Uranus and Pluto, in addition to Venus, also rotate in the opposite direction of Earth. Besides rotating backwards by Earth\u2019s standards, Venus also rotates very slowly. One day on Venus is 5832 hours or 243 Earth days. The time it takes Venus to orbit around the sun is 224.7 days. This means that a day is longer than a year on Venus. There are three related Venus datasets. This dataset is an animation that starts with the clouds of Venus, then shows the surface (similar to the first dataset) and then shows the topography of Venus.",

    "description": "Venus has been referred to by many as the sister or even twin to Earth. This is because of its similar chemical composition, density and size. That, however, is where the similarities end. Venus is not only the hottest planet in the solar system, but also the brightest. Both of these characteristics are the result of the atmosphere that surrounds the planet, which is mainly composed of carbon dioxide and some sulfuric acid. This composition allows for the greenhouse effect to be astronomical causing the planet to have a constant temperature of 864\u00b0F. The planet is the brightest because the clouds, composed of sulfur dioxide and sulfuric acid, are highly reflective. The pressure of the atmosphere that surrounds Venus is 90 times that of the atmosphere around Earth, crushing any probes that land on Venus in a matter of hours.\n\nThe orbit of Venus is the most circular in the solar system, with the perihelion (position closest to sun) and aphelion (position farthest from sun) varying only by roughly 1%. The average distance to the sun from Venus is 67,237,910 miles. An interesting feature of Venus is that the sun rises in the West and sets in the East; a result of its retrograde rotation. Uranus and Pluto, in addition to Venus, also rotate in the opposite direction of Earth. Besides rotating backwards by Earth\u2019s standards, Venus also rotates very slowly. One day on Venus is 5832 hours or 243 Earth days. The time it takes Venus to orbit around the sun is 224.7 days. This means that a day is longer than a year on Venus. This dataset is a RADAR map of the surface of Venus.",

    "description": "The main asteroid belt, composed of thousands of asteroids orbiting the sun, lies between Mars and Jupiter. Vesta is the second largest asteroid in the belt with a diameter of 330 miles (530 km), behind only Ceres in size. At 220 million miles from the sun, Vesta holds the title for being the brightest asteroid in the solar system. Vesta is also classified as the most geologically diverse asteroid, with basaltic regions that indicate that lava once flowed across the surface. It has light and dark patches, much like the moon and recent imagery reveals elongated and deep grooves with many craters in the northern hemisphere. While the northern hemisphere is cratered, the southern hemisphere tends to be smoother, with one very large crater. A group of three craters just north of the equator have been named the \"Snowman Craters\" because of their arrangement and size.\n\nImage of Vesta's actual shape taken from the Dawn Spacecraft\n\nVesta has an irregular shape, which isn't apparent when projected on Science On a Sphere. The image to the right, taken by the Dawn spacecraft in July 2011, reveals the irregular shape of Vesta. NASA's Dawn spacecraft began orbiting Vesta on July 15, 2011 and will spend a year orbiting the asteroid. Dawn's close observations of Vesta will help astronomers understand the early days of the solar system, the asteroid belt, as well as the processes that formed and shaped rocky planets like Earth, according to Chris Russell, Dawn's principal investigator at UCLA. Dawn will map Vesta at three different, and increasing lower orbits over the course of one year. Vesta is considered by many astronomers to be a protoplanet because of it's large size, saying Jupiter's gravity prevented it from developing into a rocky planet like Earth or Mars. Meteorites from Vesta have landed on Earth, making it one of only three bodies from which scientists have samples (the other two are Mars and the Moon).",

    "description": "Eyjafjallajokull, a glacier covered volcano in southern Iceland, erupted explosively on April 14, 2010. The name Eyjafjallajokull is Icelandic for \"island-mountain glacier.\" The volcano initially erupted on March 20, but this original eruption was much smaller and only caused a brief evacuation of the local area. The April 14 event was 10 to 20 times more powerful and had international impacts. Locally, the eruption and resulting lava melted the surrounding glacier, causing major flooding. Internationally, air traffic was impacted for several days following the eruption. The volcano ejected ash over 30,000ft into the atmosphere, causing significant disruptions to the European and Trans-Atlantic air travel. Airspace over much of northern Europe was closed from April 15 through April 23 for concerns over the abrasive volcanic ash causing engine failures.\n\nThe last time Eyjafjallajokull erupted in 1821, it spewed ash for over a year. The London Volcanic Ash Advisory Commission determined that the 2010 eruption stopped on May 23, 2010. Volcanologists consider a volcano to once again be dormant when all activity ceases for three months. This dataset was created with the FIM-Chem-Ash forecasting model, a global model developed by NOAA that forecasts 17 aerosol concentrations, including volcanic ash. In this dataset, only volcanic ash is included. The forecast starts April 15, the day after the eruption and runs for one week, through April 22. The effect of the weather patterns on the ash dispersion is readily apparent in this animation, as the ash cloud changes shapes and moves different directions. The transparency of the color is set on a logarithmic scale to the concentration of the ash.",

    "description": "According to the Smithsonian Institute's Global Volcanism Program, there are probably about 20 volcanoes erupting right now, and about 550 volcanoes have had historically documented eruptions. A volcano is an opening, or rupture, in the Earth's crust through which molten lava, ash, and gases are ejected. Volcanoes typically form in three different settings. The first is divergent plate boundaries, where tectonic plates are pulling apart from one another, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ocean Ridge. Most of these volcanoes are on the bottom of the ocean floor and are responsible for creating new sea floor. The second location is convergent plate boundaries, where two plates, typically an oceanic and continental plate, are colliding. The volcanoes along the Pacific Ring of Fire are from convergent plate boundaries. The third location is over hotspots, which are typically in the middle of tectonic plates and caused by hot magma rising to the surface. The volcanoes on Hawaii are the result of hotspots.\n\nThere are three datasets for Science On a Sphere that highlight global volcano locations. This dataset is from the National Geophysical Data Center's Significant Volcanic Eruption Database and shows the locations of all eruptions that have caused tsunamis.

The best way to study the global water cycle is to collect data about the whole planet. It's only in the last few decades that remote sensing technologies have advanced to a state where global measurements are accurate and thorough enough to gather the kinds of deep data sets necessary for detailed analysis. GPM will transform how humanity thinks about rainfall and fresh water management, and it will facilitate vital research into important climate questions.\n\nTo capture the holistic, all-encompassing nature of the subject, the GPM project office commissioned WATER FALLS. This 9 minute movie is designed to convey the basic architecture of the orbiting GPM fleet, as well as invest audiences in the importance of turning a critical eye onto something seemingly as ordinary as fresh water from the sky.\n\nRainfall means life on Earth, but it also offers a lens on a changing planet. A glass of clean, fresh water represents a moment of profound modernity, held in a human hand. The transmutability of water itself, endlessly moving and changing over time, perfectly illustrates the reasons we seek to understand the natural world. It's the \u00e8lan vital, and as a substance possessing qualities that transcend its seeming simplicity, water metaphorically describes the most essential qualities of life.\n\nThere are three Water Falls docent scripts available as well:\n\nLength of dataset: 8:38",

The simulation visualized here captures how much water vapor is carried in the atmosphere and circulated during the period September 1, 2006 to March 17, 2007. Such simulations allow scientists to identify the sources and pathways of atmospheric rivers, which are are relatively narrow regions in the atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor outside of the tropics.\n\nNotice the increased amounts of water vapor in the tropics. It's also possible to see the springtime afternoon showers in the Amazon and Central African Tropical Rain Forests. Red, orange and yellow indicate the highest amounts of water content in the clouds. Precipitable cyclonic motion around a low pressure center turns counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe simulation, which has a 10 kilometer resolution per grid cell, used the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) and the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) Model. It ran on 3,750 processors of the Discover supercomputer at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation.\n\nGEOS-5 development is funded by NASA\u2019s Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program.",

    "description": "This animation shows Community Earth System Model (CESM) output depicting hourly time steps of water vapor (TMQ) across the globe for an entire year. The CESM is a fully coupled, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states. This ultra-high resolution global model shows developing weather patterns in rich detail, and helps researchers understand the effect of smaller, more localized weather on the dynamics of climate at the planetary scale.\n\nThe current generation of coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) is designed to be able to perform century and multi-century simulations. With existing computing power availability, this has restricted models to have grid spacings of around 1\u00c2\u00b0 (~100km). These models adequately resolve large scale climate characteristics but do not capture smaller scale features such as tropical cyclones, which have important local impacts and may feedback to the large scale climate.\n\nIn this ultra-high resolution experiment, the Community Earth System Model was used for a 60 year simulation under \"present-day (year 2000)\" greenhouse gas conditions with much finer grid spacings of 10km to 25km. This is made possible in part thanks to the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center.\n\nThe research was enabled by the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Computational and Information Systems Laboratory (CISL) compute and storage resources, including Yellowstone, the petascale computer in the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center (NWSC), which opened in October 2012 in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nThis project was funded by Department of Energy (DOE) office of Biological and Environmental Research. Computing time was supported by DOE and National Science Foundation through its support of NCAR and the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center.",

    "description": "Meteorological offices worldwide forecast ocean wave heights for the shipping and fisheries industry. In the United States, NOAA's National Weather Service provides the wave forecasts. Just like in weather forecasting, scientists run numerical models to make these predictions.\n\nWind blowing across the ocean surface generates most ocean waves. Waves just transmit energy; the water itself does not travel with the passing of the energy. The water particles simply move up and backwards, up and forward, down and forward and finally down and backward with the passing of a wave form. This motion gives ocean waves their name: orbital waves. This movie shows wave height calculations of one of the most commonly used predictive models, called 'WAVEWATCH III\u00ae'. WAVEWATCH III\u00ae uses global and regional wind data to calculate wind-driven waves every three hours.\n\nWe measure wave height as the distance between the wave crest and trough. Note that waves come in fields containing a large variety of heights; the wave height distribution. To describe the wave field with a single number scientists use the 'Significant Wave Height'. The Significant Wave Height is the mean wave height of the one-third highest waves in the wave field. This measure is the closest to what a sailor on a ship would estimate as 'the average wave height'. Apparently our eyes are drawn to see the larger waves. This movie shows the significant wave height every 3 hours, worldwide for the year 2012.\n\nEducational materials have been developed for this dataset, including a few PowerPoint slides, that can be used on a supplementary screen while viewing the dataset on Science On a Sphere\u00ae. Also, a discussion-based lesson plan can be used to facilitate student learning about wave heights.",

The movie shows 3 hourly model output over October 1st - October 31st, 2012.\n\nOn October 22nd 2012, the storm system Sandy started forming in the Caribbean Sea and moved towards the Antilles while intensifying. By Oct 24th, Sandy became a hurricane and made landfall near Kingston, Jamaica. Passing over land weakened the storm for some time, but winds picked up and hit Cuba and the Bahamas on Oct 25th. Again, the storm system briefly weakened and then strengthened again. On Oct 29th, Hurricane Sandy took an unusual course and started curving North-Northwest and moved ashore in New Jersey, affecting New York City.\n\nThe entire storm system was exceptionally large with high winds spanning a diameter of 1800 km (1100 miles). This large diameter meant really high waves could develop. The WAVEWATCH III simulations show that the highest significant waves were 13.7m in the open ocean. At the New York harbor entrance, where some of the highest waves have already broken in shallower water, a buoy recorded wave heights of over 9m (32 ft).\n\nIn addition to the high local waves, storm surge increases the water level during hurricanes. Increasing water levels are caused both by the low pressure associated with a hurricane and with the water being pushed towards shore and being piled up. The storm surge for Hurricane Sandy increased sea level an additional 10ft near Manhattan, making the waves more impactful and causing much coastal flooding.\n\nHigh winds, rain and snow, storm surge flooding and high waves caused loss of lives and extensive damage. Over the affected countries almost 150 people were killed. In the USA alone, about 570,000 buildings were heavily damaged. Many beaches along the Eastern US seaboard were eroded by the high waves. Throughout 24 states, there were 8.6 million power outages, trains did not run anymore and 20,000 flights were cancelled. The storm caused extensive flooding in lower Manhattan.\n\nEducational materials have been developed for this dataset, including a few PowerPoint slides, that can be used on a supplementary screen while viewing the dataset on Science On a Sphere\u00ae. Also, a discussion-based lesson plan can be used to facilitate student learning about wave heights.",

    "description": "Meteorological offices worldwide forecast ocean wave heights for the shipping and fisheries industry. In the United States, NOAA's National Weather Service provides the wave forecasts. Just like in weather forecasting, scientists run numerical models to make these predictions.\n\nThis movie shows wave power calculations of one of the most commonly used wave models, called WAVEWATCH III\u00ae. WAVEWATCH III\u00ae uses global and regional wind data to calculate wind-driven waves every three hours. The model also takes into account the travel of waves beyond the edges of a storm system, the waves still continue to advance even when winds are diminished. These waves decrease in steepness and are called 'swells' and keep traveling for large distances. Swells propagate to faraway shorelines where there is no wind.\n\nWave power is calculated as a function of the significant wave height and wave period (the time to complete one complete wave cycle).\n\nEducational materials have been developed for this dataset, including a few PowerPoint slides, that can be used on a supplementary screen while viewing the dataset on Science On a Sphere\u00ae.

    "description": "In the summer of 2017, a total solar eclipse inspired many Americans with awe, as the moon passed in front of the sun briefly turning day to night. The view seen here from NOAA's GOES satellite, appears similar to what the shadow of the eclipse would look like if you were sitting on the satellite with binoculars.\n\nThe NOAA GOES, which stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, views both the Earth and the Sun from geostationary orbit, meaning that it rotates at the same speed as Earth and consistently looks at the same region of the planet. NOAA forecasts not just Earth weather but also space weather as a result of the data gathered from GOES. And to monitor space weather, we must be able to see the Sun all the time also, at least part of the Sun that faces us which changes since the sun also rotates.\n\nThis dataset also has a video clip from NASA Goddard's \"The Moon's Role in a Solar Eclipse.\" This clip answers many frequently asked questions about solar eclipses, including when and why they happen. Click here to watch the whole video, which includes details on NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Mission.\n\nImages from GOES were obtained from NOAA's VizLab and reprojected using ArcGIS Pro (for a free alternative use QGIS). The NASA video was obtained from NASA's Solar System Exploration and edited using a free open source video editing software Shotcut.",

    "description": "Models create a dynamic portrait of the Earth through numerical experiments that simulate our current knowledge of the dynamical and physical processes governing weather and climate variability. The simulation visualized here captures the speed of winds at the tropopause, about 6-9 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface during the period September 1, 2006 to March 17, 2007. Such simulations allow scientists to view the intensity and turbulence of the polar and sub-tropic jet streams, which carry weather around the globe. Red, orange and yellow are used for the fastest moving air.\n\nJet streams are the major means of transport for weather systems. A jet stream is an area of strong winds ranging from 120-250 mph that can be thousands of miles long, a couple of hundred miles across and a few miles deep. Jet streams usually sit at the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere at a level called the tropopause. This means most jet streams are about 6-9 miles off the ground.\n\nThe higher latitude polar jet stream tends to be stronger than it's lower latitude subtropical jet stream neighbor. During the winter months, the northern hemispheric polar jet moves equatorially bringing polar cold fronts to lower latitudes. During the summer as the cold air retreats, it moves poleward. In this dataset, you can start to see the northern polar jet plunging down deeper into the U.S. The Antarctic Polar Vortex encircles the southernmost continent completely and acts as a buffer against warm air.\n\nThe simulation, which has a 10 kilometer resolution per grid cell, used the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) and the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) Model. It ran on 3,750 processors of the Discover supercomputer at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation.\n\nGEOS-5 development is funded by NASA\u2019s Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction Program.",
