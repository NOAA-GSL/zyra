# Zyra Assistant Instructions (Deprecated Copy)

This page is out of date. The authoritative system instructions for the Zyra Assistant live in the main Zyra repository:

https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/zyra/blob/main/llm/prompts/zyra_helper_bot_system.md

Please refer to that file for the latest guidance, scope, and behavior. This wiki page remains only as a pointer for discoverability.

Notes
- The assistant is referred to as “Zyra Assistant” (not “Helper Bot”).  
- For project docs and usage, see the wiki Home, Workflow-Stages.md, and Stage-Examples.md.  
- For active work and plans, see Roadmap-and-Tracking.md.
